            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Papers, like <hi>Orphans</hi> meanly deſcended, are glad to forget their original, and innoble themſelves with the <hi>Adoption</hi> of your Commands. The title you have to them transfers a <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive honour,</hi> which is the whole of what they claim to inherit. You have truſted the <hi>richeſt Jewel</hi> in the hands of a mean <hi>Artiſt,</hi> by whom 'twill be ſet with great diſadvantage. You have committed the <hi>nobleſt</hi> of ſubjects to a priſon of <hi>low thoughts;</hi> where 'tis debaſed beneath it ſelf, like a rich ſoil under a barren <hi>Genius.</hi> The reproach of the higheſt thoughts, in their beſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſuffers here a confinement to the <hi>ſtraits</hi> of a very narrow capacity. However, he that <hi>liſts</hi> himſelf in the defence of truth, though he <hi>fight</hi> ill, is ſure to be of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours ſide. And he that <hi>duels</hi> an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> can never want a good <hi>ſecond:</hi> The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt defence often makes a ſtand, and gives occaſion to greater forces to ralley. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the happy ſling of a ſtone may ſtab
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95663:4"/>A <hi>Goliah</hi> in the forehead, and rout his whole rere-guard.</p>
            <p>Every man cannot lead an <hi>Army</hi> for Truth, but all men ſhould follow the <hi>Camp;</hi> no man ſhould ever meet an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> unarm'd, but wear a conſtant weapon in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to fight him. Each man combates not the ſame way; I have provided a <hi>Sling</hi> for ſuch as cannot bear <hi>heavier Armour,</hi> notions that lie <hi>even</hi> to mean capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that he may be able to <hi>bolt his door</hi> againſt an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> that cannot <hi>build a Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> for his defence. When <hi>Atheiſm</hi> ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly batters us on all ſides, 'tis time to caſt our eyes every way. The weakeſt places ſhould be firſt ſecured; and ſuch who can leaſt make a reſiſtance, ſhould be moſt taken care for. This is the <hi>Poſt</hi> I have undertaken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me by my own diſability to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I have choſe to help thoſe that are leaſt knowing; to interpoſe my <hi>feeble aid</hi> where I ſee the weakeſt front, and the worſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to endure a ſhock; nor will you blame me, if I am pleaſed with a <hi>Subject,</hi> where I am ſure to live by the warmth of reflection; if I contend for the loweſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; am proud of any admiſſion into ſuch a ſervice, where the meaneſt <hi>Livery</hi> carries <hi>Grandeur,</hi> and the <hi>loweſt Officer</hi> muſt needs be a dignified perſon. This choice, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95663:4"/>it beſt ſecures me againſt the juſteſt of fears, [that ſo noble a cauſe ſhould ſuffer by a weak defence, in the hand of an impotent Champion;] ſo the ſuitableneſs of it to the <hi>moſt of my ſelf,</hi> gives me hopes of the ſame acceptance he found under the Law with <hi>the Sacrifice of a Turtle,</hi> that wanted a better Offering. <hi>My Lord,</hi> This prepares you to know, I diſclaim the vanity of <hi>inſtructing you</hi> by this diſcourſe. 'Tis compoſed for <hi>you to correct;</hi> for ignorance, <hi>to learn</hi> by. You eſpouſed the concerns of others, when you commanded this from me. Should I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> a better <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> I ſhould ſhake hands with that fooliſh <hi>Oratour,</hi> who being to make an Oration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hannibal,</hi> went about to inſtruct him in the art of War. 'Tis the many unlearned and unſtable, who ſteer not by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of <hi>right reaſon,</hi> but by the winds of every falſe notion, and every <hi>deluding So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm,</hi> that challenge diſcourſes of this kind, and make them a debt due from us. Thoſe that have been the guard of every age, have ſtill encountred the predominant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. The world (in every ſtage of it) has <hi>beſmeared it ſelf</hi> with ſome peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; has corrupted into ſome <hi>new</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, or improved ſome <hi>old</hi> diſeaſe. We ſeem, at once, greedily to have ſwallowed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95663:5"/>the dregs of the <hi>whole,</hi> and to have <hi>epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized</hi> the worlds <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> in the fatal Plague of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> We ſkirmiſh not like other ages, <hi>to retail ſingle truths;</hi> but the <hi>whole of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> lies at ſtake with us. He that yields the field to an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> has at once betrayed all divine truth to the block; and left the nobleſt property of his ſoul in the hand of his worſt enemy. All other diſtempers naturally fall in here; they all iſſue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into this infection; men think it the <hi>cheapest</hi> way of becoming <hi>vile.</hi> The <hi>troubles</hi> men are at from the efforts of conſcience, and the convincing aſpect of <hi>ſome open-faced truths,</hi> have, by this, a ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, and ſeem ſhortly diſmiſſed out of the world. They that are <hi>uneaſie under all Religion,</hi> if they can once perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>there is no God,</hi> think they have found a happy expedient to eaſe them of thoſe cares. This makes the knowledge of God, in theſe daies, to be grown ſo cheap a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,</hi> and lie like a drug upon ſo many mens hands; they will gladly <hi>barter</hi> it away for an empty notion of <hi>Atoms,</hi> or any plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible trifle; the worſt ware ſerves them, ſo it come in the room of Religion; they'l never <hi>diſpute the terms,</hi> if they can but <hi>come to a bargain;</hi> they think they have got all, and parted with nothing.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95663:5"/>
            <p>I am contending, by this ſmall endeavour, ſome little to <hi>antidote</hi> the poiſon of this diſeaſe: to forbid the fury of ſuch a <hi>Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie;</hi> to ſpeak to men in the native language of their own <hi>reaſon;</hi> to meet with them in the <hi>cool</hi> of the day, and treat with them when the heat of this diſtemper may be ſome what abated.</p>
            <p>The man that turns from God, and diſowns him, <hi>unhinges</hi> himſelf from the beſt of his own being; is highly unjuſt to his Maker, and forfeits his own intereſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf. It were not more unnatural, ſhould the <hi>leaves</hi> of a tree drop <hi>poiſon</hi> upon their own <hi>root:</hi> nor leſs deſtructive ſhould the earth refuſe the warmth of the Sun. The glory of man lies in his Supreme Head; 'tis his <hi>deſcent</hi> that innobles him: 'tis the Divine Image that greatens him, and crowns him <hi>King of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

Nor can we deny the <hi>exiſtence of God,</hi> without ſome way aſſaulting our ſelves. He muſt firſt deſign a <hi>rape</hi> upon his own reaſon, that reſolves to have nothing <hi>above
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95663:6"/>him.</hi> Our reaſonable part diſowns all friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and is a continual <hi>Herauld</hi> proclaiming God in the world. The bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all ſober thoughts and enquiries bring men ſtill to <hi>Divinity.</hi> How meanly does the <hi>Atheiſt philoſophize</hi> when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting with God, when he is projecting an Image, and framing an Idol to ſupply his place! when he is creating, in his own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect,</hi> an Eternity for the world! or when he is <hi>equipping his Atoms</hi> into ſuch a poſture, and contriving them into ſuch a <hi>Motion,</hi> as might oblige the world with a donation of its Being! When, inſtead of a <hi>Deity</hi> in the <hi>greateſt heights</hi> above us, he will needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive us from ſomewhat in <hi>the loweſt depths</hi> beneath us! Though God cannot be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>natural eye,</hi> yet he alwaies ſtands full in the eye of our reaſon; has choſen to convey himſelf to us by that <hi>Nobleſt Faculty,</hi> as the moſt comprehensive part of our own Beings, and ſo the moſt ſuitable to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: there we know ſo much of him as fills the <hi>All</hi> of our beſt capacity; and by the ſafeſt way we have of knowing enough, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us that ſuch a <hi>Being</hi> does aſſiſt. Should he deſcend to any other converſe with us, it would rather <hi>amaze</hi> than <hi>ſatisfie,</hi> and more affright us, than inform us. How vain is he that denies there is a God, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95663:6"/>not graſp the <hi>whole of his Being!</hi> When we meet with nothing but has ſomewhat above us. Were it reaſonable to deny the truth of any <hi>Material Being,</hi> becauſe our thoughts can never land us beyond the laſt <hi>diviſion of quantity?</hi> What we can fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, we have the leaſt reaſon to adore. The notions we have of God in our own ſouls, of an infinite and perfect Being, loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaim to us our own incapacity to know the utmoſt of him. The <hi>frame</hi> of <hi>our ſelves</hi> is a curtain drawn between us and a full view of what is <hi>infinite.</hi> When we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt too near approaches to things ſo much above us, we exceed the bounds of our own Beings, and gain nothing but the reproach of our own folly.</p>
            <p>He that devotes himſelf to the ſervice of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> will find he has <hi>bored his ear</hi> to the worſt of ſlavery: And when he thinks he is moſt at liberty, will find, he has made himſelf but his own <hi>priſon.</hi> Whoever trades with another, or accoſts himſelf to be the <hi>Atheiſts Proſelyte,</hi> makes an attempt ariſing from the worſt intention, and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the moſt impracticable execution. He can never intend well, that would <hi>ſue a Divorce</hi> between God an the world; that would rob the <hi>One</hi> of the work of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95663:7"/>hand, and the <hi>other</hi> of the reward of their labours. He that allows mankind no hope beyond <hi>themſelves,</hi> impoſeth a <hi>negative</hi> upon their beſt expectation; makes the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the world very <hi>uneaſie,</hi> without a proſpect of ſome reverſion. The Diſciple of an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> is bowed down to the worſt of condition; he rejects all hopes of a <hi>happy futurity,</hi> and ſtands all the ventures of a <hi>future miſery.</hi> The fundamentals of an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> are all begged ſuppoſals. No man can inſure another that negative, [That there is no God:] nor <hi>counter-ſecure</hi> him if he miſtake. Should it ever appear that <hi>God is,</hi> all he has then gained, is an authority to himſelf to live ill here, and a ſecurity of being inchained as the higheſt Rebel hereafter.</p>
            <p>Nor has he undertaken an <hi>eaſie Province,</hi> that deſigns to ſhut God out of the world, and bolt the door faſt upon him. He's more wiſely at work that is buſily ſtopping out the <hi>Tide</hi> with his foot, or he that firſt ſhuts up himſelf in the dark, and then forbids the Sun to ſhine. He that will compleat an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt have more than the conſent of his <hi>own will</hi> to it; the forcible evidences God has given in of himſelf to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, muſt be firſt taken out of the way; <hi>Conſcience</hi> muſt be silenced; God muſt <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95663:7"/>and give his conſent to the work. If <hi>reaſon</hi> want an anſwer, complain of its doubts, the conſcience enter its diſſent, and God puts in his claim; at the beſt of ſuch a caſe, a man ſtands <hi>divided againſt himſelf.</hi> Yea his <hi>unruly appetite</hi> ſtands ſingle to conteſt all his ſober reſults; he becomes <hi>certain</hi> in <hi>nothing,</hi> and ſo is betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to unhappineſs in every thing.

And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>monſter</hi> to his own ſoul, that kneels to his own Deity, and makes himſelf his own Idol.</p>
            <p>How far any man ever yet ſailed in this <hi>mare mortuum;</hi> how far ever God anſwered any man according to this folly, and (chuſing his deluſion) left him to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dream of an <hi>Atheiſtical Faith;</hi> let the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> himſelf then determine, when (without a diſturbance from God, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or his reaſon) he has lived over his <hi>own Being,</hi> and at laſt finds, he has breathed himſelf into <hi>nothing</hi> but the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion</hi> of the world.</p>

Nor have I rouſed the <hi>old Philoſophers</hi> much to aſſiſt me, who are yet generally the foes of an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> All which I might well have undertaken, as being no appurtenant to the hardeſt part of this performance. I have rather choſe to entertain the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> with ſuch <hi>plain Blows,</hi> as my weak hand was able to beſtow upon him: and to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Your Lordſhip</hi> the courſe food of mine own labours, rather than feaſt you with other mens dainties.</p>
            <p>Before I come to cloſe with the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and try the moſt of his ſtrength, I ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95663:8"/>
               <hi>attacque</hi> him at ſome diſtance, and view ſome of his out-works. And it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily be neither unpleaſing to <hi>Your Lordſhip,</hi> nor unuſeful to the work in hand, if I firſt lay before you thoſe things, which to me, ſeem more eſpecially to have been in this age, the ſteps that have gradually led to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and the unhappy promoters of ſo ſad a defection; and they will come under theſe ſeveral heads following. To all which I muſt premiſe, that <hi>'tis no way neceſſary, that ſuch who deny all ſupernatural knowledge of God, ſhould thereby become open avowers of Atheiſm,</hi> becauſe there are principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, that do ſufficiently preſerve men in their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to a Deity, without any thing ſupernatural. But yet, where men, in poſſeſſion of <hi>Supernatural Revelation,</hi> upon any account begin to oppoſe and reject it, as it moſt commonly ariſeth from a general diſlike to the notion of a Deity and Religion; ſo it uſually ends in a total deſertion of both.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>To bottom all Religion upon humane authority, and derive it from the power and pleaſure of men,</hi> tends (in the conſequences of it) to deſtroy all Religion, and at laſt to bring men to no Religion. If we once
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95663:9"/>take away <hi>divine Authority</hi> from Religion, we have made an inrode upon its beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. It will never be kept up, with any other intereſt in the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of men: and where 'tis not ſupported by the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> 'tis ever tottering, and yields to the blaſts of every <hi>humane pleaſure.</hi> If once it be taken for granted, that <hi>the Scriptures have no Authority, but what the Civil Power gives them,</hi> they will ſoon come, upon a divine account, to have <hi>none</hi> at all. Nothing gratifies the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> more, when he is pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the pillars of Religion, than po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of this nature. 'Tis to render the homage, men pay to Religion as a thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, upon even terms with the reverence men pay to an Idol. When they come at laſt to conſider, 'tis <hi>nothing in the world;</hi> that is, 'tis nothing of what they in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip take it to be; that 'tis a thing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane make; a piece of wood, or a piece of ſtone; that has nothing upon it but the ſtamp of mens Artifice: and that 'tis not an intrinſique worth, but the art and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of men that give it its authority; their reverence will, in time, wear off from it, and they will come to value it juſt as it is. Dangerous therefore to the concerns of Religion, are the conſequences of ſuch aſſertions as tend this way. An Author,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95663:9"/>not a little popular, amongſt many other expreſſions that complexion the ſame way, hath this paſſage; ſaies he, <hi>The Apoſtles could not make their Writings obligatory Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, without the help of the Soveraign Civil Power: and therefore the Scripture of the New Teſtament is there only Law, where the Civil Power hath made it ſo. Hobs Leviathan, Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>p.</hi> 285. And in his 38 Chapter he tells us plainly: <hi>'Tis impoſſible a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould ſtand, where any greater rewards and puniſhments are talked of, than what the Civil Soveraign is able to diſpenſe, which is preſent life, and preſent death;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayes, that <hi>eternal life, and eternal death, being higher rewards and puniſhments, are things well to be conſidered of, what is meant by them!</hi> And toward the end of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concludes; <hi>There is no ground to believe any one man ſhould have an eternal life in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> Which things correſond well to the deſcription he gives of Religion it ſelf in the beginning of his book; where he tells us, in his ſixth chapter, in theſe words, that <hi>fear of Power inviſible, feigned by the mind, or imagined from tales publickly told, is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Firſt, ſuch notions as theſe about the <hi>Scripture</hi> make it impoſſible, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould ever be <hi>legally</hi> preached in any <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then State;</hi> for where 'tis <hi>no Law,</hi> it can
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95663:10"/>never be lawfully preached as a Law. And Secondly, Whoever is ſo diſcipled to them, as to believed, 'tis in the power of every State whether the Goſpel ſhall be <hi>Authentique</hi> or not, muſt needs throw off all divine reſpect to it, and be in a very fair way to trouble himſelf little with any devotion ariſing from it. The whole of theſe Principles point men to direct <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and have accordingly found a grateful acceptance amongſt ſuch as travel that way. The plain effect of them is, to make the riſe and termination of <hi>all Religion</hi> to be from civil and humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and a power inherent in, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>from this viſible world;</hi> and that all things <hi>beyond this world</hi> are meerly fabulous, and ſuch <hi>Phantaſms,</hi> as men have fondly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and created within themſelves. How can the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> have better ſervice done him, than to have a <hi>nullity</hi> put upon the <hi>Divinity of all Religion;</hi> and to have thoſe great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of it in the minds of men (eternal rewards and puniſhments) ſecretly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and demoliſhed? The ultimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all theſe <hi>documents,</hi> is, that men come at laſt firmly to believe nothing, and ſo freely practiſe any thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>When a practical conformity to the plain common truths of Religion is rendered
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95663:10"/>a thing to be derided, and turned into a common mockery; as a thing foppiſh and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous;</hi> 'tis a plain preſage of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> Though it be done to the practice of thoſe, whoſe principles, in other things, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much diſlike; and upon the account of a Religion, never ſo much otherwiſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; 'tis the ready way to make men ſerve all Religion ſo, and at laſt, to deride at the whole Syſteme of it under any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or practices whatſoever. 'Tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe, that there ſhould be any other bottom of a mans denying himſelf in forbearing to ſin, and doing ſuch things, as would otherwiſe pleaſe and advantage him, but <hi>Religion</hi> and conſcience, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its riſe from the ſenſe of an <hi>eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above him,</hi> that forbids ſuch things. And therefore, when a man lies under contempt for ſo doing, the truth of ſuch proceedings is to mock at all notion of a Deity, and the Being of God himſelf. As the chiefeſt, ſo the moſt amiable part of Religion lies in the <hi>practick;</hi> if that once come under <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> all the <hi>Theory</hi> of it will ſoon expire. He that will deride a man becauſe he will not <hi>lye</hi> for his advantage, and <hi>be unjuſt</hi> for his gain, nor be <hi>prophane</hi> to pleaſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; will ſcorn him much more if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a <hi>Trinity in Heaven,</hi> and mens <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95663:11"/>again after death.</hi> Matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be <hi>ſacredly</hi> kept from <hi>prophane</hi> contempt. Such things as are the <hi>common coin</hi> of all Chriſtians, though they be done either upon <hi>grounds miſtaken,</hi> or <hi>principles hypocritical,</hi> yet they are well done for the bare act of them, and ſo far challenge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. We muſt not pretend to ſuch a <hi>Superiority</hi> over the <hi>rectitude</hi> of mens judgements, or the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of mens inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to take occaſion thereby to ſcorn all practice of Religion out of the world. When the moſt indiſputable parts of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> nay, the <hi>practice of any Religion</hi> comes to be the publick ſport of mens wit, and the triumph of common <hi>drollery;</hi> when men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the exerciſe of their parts to find out the moſt appoſite waies to make Divinity the great object of publick deriſion and contempt, it cannot but preſage a drowning deluge of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> Men can never be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with that, and <hi>reverence</hi> it, at one time, which they make the ſubject of their <hi>ſcorn</hi> at another. Render a Prince or a State <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous before the people,</hi> and once bring them under open contempt, and you will ſoon remove the peoples obedience; and in that purſuit, ſoon debaſe government it ſelf, to be trodden down, and trampled under foot. Things of this nature have inſenſibly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95663:11"/>begotten men into <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> and diſguſted them from all ſeriouſneſs in Religion; and made a man of any conſcience ſeem the higheſt embleme of abſurdity; and at laſt, men rather chuſe to ſay, <hi>There is no God,</hi> as thinking it every way more decent, than to retain a naked acknowledgement of one, and yet to act ſuch things as plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn him, and carry an open defiance to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The multiplicity of oaths that were, ſome late years paſt, amongſt us:</hi> the taking and renouncing them, <hi>backward</hi> and <hi>forward,</hi> has been no uſeleſs friend to <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> This has deflowred our integrity, and taken away the virginity of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and made a dangerous invaſion upon all honeſty among men, and all Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God. He that once comes to caſt off his reverence and dread of God in an oath, which is the higheſt and neareſt appeal to him, will caſt it off in any thing, and at laſt, come to declare open war with conſcience in every thing. The Land mourns with <hi>Atheiſm</hi> becauſe of theſe <hi>oaths.</hi> We muſt record it as none of the leaſt of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in this age, that men have been ſo unhappily provoked and tempted in this matter of <hi>oaths.</hi> For, either by oppoſing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95663:12"/>conſcience, or dallying with it, in ſo high a concern as an <hi>oath,</hi> they have, at laſt, taken leave of all Religion; and have briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved all the doubts and diſputes about the ſeveral obligations ariſing from ſeveral <hi>oaths,</hi> by thinking, that there is no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from any. The impoſing contrary <hi>oaths,</hi> is ſo far from ſecuring any body, that it deceives every body. The laſt impoſer uſually attains the leaſt of his end. For men (to avoid the dreadful ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in ſuch caſes) recur to plain <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> and that ſets them beyond the reach of an <hi>oath,</hi> or any other obligation whatſoever. And when we think we have tyed them up faſteſt, they break through all thoſe things, and as much deſpiſe them as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his <hi>green Withs.</hi> 'Tis the wiſdom of a State to preſerve conſcience as a ſacred Jewel; and eſpecially in that higheſt exerciſe of it in an <hi>oath.</hi> Such who cannot be bound faſt to God by oaths lawfully adminiſtred, will never be bound ſafe to their King, nor ſure one to another. 'Tis the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> that we groan under, that occaſions that common trade of perjury, that is driven on amongſt thoſe, upon whoſe integrity to an <hi>oath</hi> the <hi>all</hi> of our humane concerns depends. That reverence men had heretofore of an oath, this age ſcoffs at. When men, by falſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95663:12"/>ſwearing and lying to God in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn appeals to him, are grown into open hoſtility with him; they think <hi>Atheiſm</hi> the beſt way to determine the controverſie. By that they hope to extinguiſh the trouble of what is paſt, and to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the quiet poſſeſſion of ſuch courſes for the future.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The contempt that has been caſt upon the Scriptures, and all ſupernatural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> has opened a wide door to <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> Men ſeldom keep true to the principles of <hi>natural</hi> Religion, that caſt away all <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> Revelation. Men have ſo kicked at what is ſupernatural, and ſo much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned and doubted thoſe things, and the manner of their conveyance to the world; that at laſt they have combated their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light, and denied the truth of a Deity. We muſt not imagine ſupernatural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſuch a thing, that 'tis not capable of oppoſition. The Devil has not ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a game to play in the world: he has ſome <hi>miſts</hi> to bring men into, where he may couzen and miſlead them. God has not made the world ſo as to ſatisfie the captious queſtions of every forward perverſe diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that deſigns to himſelf diſ-ſatisfaction. He has left us no anſwer to thoſe that aſk, why he did not make the world in a day;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95663:13"/>nay, why not by a word; which he could have done as well as to have taken <hi>ſix daies</hi> time to do it in: nor why he made ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creatures that ſeem to be of no uſe; and others that ſeem to do nothing but hurt; and a thouſand other ſuch queſtions. God has reſerved ſuch kind of objections to the anſwer of his own Soveraignty. If men muſt needs know why God does not continually ſpeak to the world, and <hi>viva voce</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every thing, and put all things out of doubt; if they muſt needs know why God does not come down, as he did upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to ſatisfie men of the truth of his Law; and why Chriſt does not often come down from Heaven, and work <hi>Miracles</hi> to confirm the truth of the Goſpel; God hath intruſted no man with an anſwer to ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and abſurd queſtions. Nor would ſuch men, who aſk ſuch queſtions, be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more ſatisfied with ſuch things, if they were done, than now they are. The <hi>Jews</hi> found a way to evade the miracles of Chriſt, and to father them upon the power of the Devil; and ſo to credit nothing he ſaid. He that now calls for <hi>Ocular</hi> and <hi>Mathematical</hi> demonſtrations about the Scriptures and the proof of them, (or elſe he will believe nothing, but look upon all ſupernatural Revelation as a fabulous ſtory) 'tis as much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95663:13"/>as to ſay, he will not believe thoſe things, unleſs he have ſuch proofs of them, as are <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be had, and the nature of them will no way bear; which is all one as to to ſay, he is poſitively reſolved before-hand, not to believe them at all. Although we were not, at the firſt, eye-witneſſes of Gods delivery of the Scriptures to the world, nor of thoſe miracles by which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd; nor have an infallibility in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtance of their conveyance down to us; that is, we do not ſay that every <hi>Tranſcriber,</hi> and every <hi>Printer</hi> of them was, or is infallible; but that 'tis poſſible (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the utmoſt of all humane care) in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or a word, there may happen to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes (of which no other uſe can be made, but to quicken and continue our diligence about them;) yet for the whole <hi>body of the Scriptures,</hi> we have all the reaſon to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us about the truth of them, that any thing, that we have not actually ſeen, is poſſibly capable of. And, ſetting aſide its own <hi>innate worth,</hi> and the evidence it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it of its own divine authority, we have all the collateral proof of moral teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that any ſuch thing can have. And upon that ſingle account, without any other (ſetting by all the effects of it) have as good reaſon to believe the truth of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95663:14"/>Scripture, as to believe any other thing whatſoever, that we our ſelves have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. How ridiculous would he appear to be, that would believe nothing but what he has ſeen? deny all Records of things paſt; and the exiſtence of any part of the world now, but juſt what he has beheld? He that has lived in the remoteſt part of <hi>England,</hi> may be as ſure there is ſuch a place as <hi>London,</hi> as he can be of any <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> propoſition; for there is as much certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the kind of the one, as there is in the kind of the other; and both capable of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in their kind; and yet the one is not capable of the <hi>ſame way of probation</hi> with the other. He that will go about to perſwade me, I may be couzened in ſuch a moral belief, and cannot arrive at a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I may, with as good reaſon, trouble him with objections, and provoke him to doubt of what he himſelf ſees; and tell him, either his <hi>eye-ſight</hi> may fail, or miſ-inform him; or elſe the object may be ſuch as may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely diſpoſed to couzen and delude his fight; in the one a man hath nothing but the ſingle teſtimony of his <hi>own eyes;</hi> in the other the teſtimony of thouſands transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him upon unqueſtionable credit. The worſt deſigners againſt Religion cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>univerſal teſtimony of all ages</hi> to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95663:14"/>the body of the Scripture; even out of the mouths of its greateſt enemies it may be juſtified; who (laboring to confute it, and overthrow the doctrine of it) have left us an undeniable reſtimony to the truth of the <hi>fact</hi> of it. Thoſe, who moſt oppoſed it in the ages when it looked firſt abroad, had never the impudence to deny the <hi>Being</hi> of it; nor the being of it with ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as enough juſtifie the divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it. And for the differences in the <hi>Copies</hi> and <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of the Scripture it ſelf, (which men have ſo magnified and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied to invalidate its authority, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the credit of the whole) after the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence of the moſt learned, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all the <hi>Copies,</hi> and all the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of thoſe <hi>Copies,</hi> that are extant, or can be found; and all the care that poſſibly could be taken therein, (and never was there ſo great exactneſs and care about any writing ſince the world began) and the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the moſt malicious objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that way; ſo eminent does the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God appear in preſerving the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures entire, that the differences and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations do appear ſo ſmall, ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo far from undermining the whole; that they have not ſo much as in the leaſt ſhaken any <hi>one Divine Truth,</hi> or diſturbed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95663:15"/>us in our belief of any one point in religion; but have poured out abundant ſhame upon thoſe, who built their deſigns to ruine the Scriptures upon that foundation: and have rendred them equally wiſe, and equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous with ſuch, who would deny the relation of a book to its Author, and deny the whole of any Treatiſe, becauſe of ſome ſmall inconſiderable <hi>Errata</hi>'s in the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Such things may gratifie peeviſh and forward perſons, who gape for objections; but will never find acceptance with ſober and unprejudic'd men. Let ſuch who take the greateſt pleaſure to make the <hi>Scriptures</hi> the object of their contempt, conſider but ſoberly with themſelves, if there be any thing ſupernatural; if God has ever reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf further to the world, than in that knowledge he gave us of himſelf in our firſt make: (which we have abundant reaſon to believe he has) how could it be handed down to us upon more <hi>credible</hi> terms?</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Scripture it ſelf, written in a way wholly becoming ſuch an Author as God himſelf and no other; and in ſuch a way as does plainly <hi>ſpirare divinitasem;</hi> with ſuch majeſty, authority, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, as relate themſelves to God; and with ſuch poſitive <hi>predictions</hi> in it, of things to come; and writing with that certainty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95663:15"/>about things many hundred years off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and future, as if it were a hiſtory of things paſt or preſent; and the punctual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments the whole world has been witneſs to of theſe predictions; bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto its ſelf. Thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied of <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name, and foretold he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and ruine their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, a hundred and four years before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was born. And other ſuch like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions innumerable there are contained in them; which, as they moſt evidently tell us, there is a God, and ſomewhat above the world; ſo they unanſwerably declare the Scriptures to be his word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Scriptures, the principles of it being ſuch, as are moſt ſuitabre and agreeing to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light, and that image of God, and the diſtinguiſhing taſte of good from evil, we received from God in our firſt conſtitution, is of the ſame conſideration. Nothing can be deviſed more uſeful and profitable for all publick <hi>Societies,</hi> and all private converſe, than the principles the Scriptures offer to us. Nor did any thing ever ſo much heighten all natural Religion, and bring men to ſo neer a converſe with God, and ſo great a conformity upon that account to him; or induce any thing ſo much for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95663:16"/>the common and general good of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. No man can well deny, but that he that lives a life conformed to the Scriptures, ſhall live moſt to God, beſt to himſelf, and moſt uſefully to all mankind; and to the height of thoſe excellent principles which all the and ſerious men, ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, have juſtified and applauded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The whole <hi>matter of fact</hi> about the Scripture, and the Miracles wrought, to eſtabliſh them, deſcends to us with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concurring teſtimony from the ages wherein they were tranſacted. And we have as much to aſſure us and ſatisfie us in that, as ſuch a thing is capable of; as much indeed as can be had about a thing paſt and not ſeen by our ſelves; and ſo much as we ought fully to acquieſce in. No <hi>matter of fact</hi> about the Scripture can otherwiſe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us that live in diſtant ages: And matter of fact muſt neceſſarily belong to it, and have its proof that way; unleſs the Bible had every age a new edition, and were often re-delivered and re-printed from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A <hi>divine Power</hi> there is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture, to gain it an intereſt and reception in the world, which is peculiar to it ſelf, and nothing elſe can boaſt of. To thoſe, who by themſelves know there is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95663:16"/>ſuch a <hi>divine Power</hi> attending the Scriptures, 'tis to them an infallible argument of the truth of them: and to others that ſtand by, an argument of <hi>high probability;</hi> becauſe they hear many, who are ſober and ſerious, atteſting it, whoſe credit they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reject. And they themſelves, in ſuch mens practice, ſee the viſible effects of it, and a great part of the world converted by it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that will ſlight over all theſe things, and reſolve to deſpiſe and reject them: that will object againſt the <hi>firſt,</hi> and tell you, that the <hi>ſtyle</hi> of the Scripture is nothing, but an effect of their cunning and deſign, who intended to cheat the world by it, and ſo perſonated God as much as they could; that thoſe <hi>predictions</hi> of things to come, were only put in to gain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to it at the firſt, and have fince, by chance, come to paſs; or elſe that men fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw them by the natural courſe of the Stars. That ſay to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> they cannot find that excellency in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Scriptures we ſpeak of; but rather find it interrupts and croſſes them in all thoſe things they take moſt delight and pleaſure in. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wholly the <hi>third,</hi> and throw away all be1ief of things paſt; and reſolve to credit nothing but what they ſee. That mock at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95663:17"/>the <hi>fourth</hi> (the divine Power attending the Scripture) and deny the Being of any ſuch thing; think it a vain imagination; and tell you, that many <hi>fabulous ſtories,</hi> and falſe Religions, have equally gained upon the world; and found many that have reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly bowed down themſelves to them, and ſubmitted to deluding impoſitions from them. Thoſe, I ſay, that will thus object, and feed upon this kind of traſh; that find a way to convert into humour and diſeaſe all ſuch notions of things, as are the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing food of ſober and reaſonable men; and reſolve to believe nothing they do not <hi>like;</hi> that will deny the truth of all divine and rational impreſſions upon mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of them are deluded and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and will admit no men to have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a right knowledge in divine things, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the trueſt exerciſe of their rational faculties, becauſe part of the world, either by weakneſs or corruption, are under the dominion of vanity and lies: Such men are moſt puniſhed when they are left to themſelves; nor is it leſs vain to endeavour their ſatisfaction, than to make a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about colours to one that we know <hi>cannot,</hi> or elſe is reſolved that he <hi>will</hi> not look upon them; or to convine him of the harmony of any ſound, that reſolves
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95663:17"/>before-hand to make no uſe of his ears; or, at leaſt, to call every thing diſcord, that does not ſuit with ſome <hi>ill ſound</hi> his ears are already poſſeſſed with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Supernatural Religion</hi> is a thing propoſed to men with reaſon abundantly ſufficient to ſatisfie a man, reaſonably willing to be ſatisfied, and to leave him without excuſe if he be not ſatisfied. And beſides all other proofs of it, the ſame humane evidence, by which we reſt ſatisfied in all other things that we do not ſee, deſcends to all ages; but not with anſwers to every fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſſenters objections, that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute without end againſt the truth of it, becauſe he diſlikes the matter of it; and be ſo abſurdly diſingenuous to deny that to be a good proof to him of the truth of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by which he himſelf reſts ſatisfied in the truth of a thouſand other things. He that will give no credit to any divine revelation, unleſs God will ſatisfie his <hi>curioſity</hi> in the manner of its convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the world, ſayes, in effect, though God have given me other good reaſon, and ſuch as he thought ſufficient for me to believe him, and upon which he has made it my duty to believe him; and <hi>ſuch reaſon,</hi> as I my ſelf think ſufficient for the belief of all other things of the like nature; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95663:18"/>ſuch as I think abundant proof to make good any thing I have a mind to; yet I <hi>will not</hi> believe him, unleſs I pleaſe. And though my reaſon tell me, that ſome Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuperiour to all Beings, made the world; Yet, unleſs I had ſeen him do it, I will not believe it.</p>
            <p>Such men are monſtrous <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> men that live upon fancy; that fancy to themſelves, how God ſhould govern the world, and how he ſhould reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it; and becauſe he does not do it according to their <hi>fancy,</hi> and deſcend to gratifie their fond imaginations, they make it a Law to themſelves, that they will neither receive nor admit any of his Laws, nor pay any acknowledgement to his Being. What delight have men taken of late to upbraid the Scriptures with all kind of uncertainty in the <hi>delivery</hi> of them, and all kind of contradictions and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in the <hi>matter</hi> of them! Mens wits and parts have encreaſed their value with very many, as they could beſt enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on theſe heads; and deſpiſe others, as <hi>weak</hi> and to be pitied, who make any ſtand for divine Truth. By this, men tempt themſelves and others into a mean value of Religion, and at laſt, into the higheſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion. 'Tis, I confeſs, a noble enquiry
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95663:18"/>to ſearch into the <hi>grounds of Religion,</hi> that ſo we may be rationally aſcertained of its truth, and not take our greateſt concern upon truſt. But to deal in thoſe things with no other intention, but to tie knots, to invent vexing queſtions, and peeviſh objections; and, becauſe the Scriptures croſs mens boundleſs appetites, to load them with all imaginable diſgrace and contempt, that ſo God may be more eaſily diſmiſſed out of the world: if we deal with the Scriptures, I ſay, upon no better or other account, 'tis no wonder if the ſucceſs be accordingly; and that men, ſteering ſuch a courſe, not only turn their backs upon all <hi>ſupernatural Religion;</hi> but at laſt arrive at the utmoſt confines of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and contempt of Religion it ſelf in down-right <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, 'Tis no unuſual thing to ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that if they may not enjoy the <hi>worſhip</hi> they are affected to, and think the beſt, will go to none at all. And from ſuch a habit once gotten, 'tis eaſie to foreſee what a precipice of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> men are at the brink of. All men are not ſo well <hi>catechized</hi> in Religion, nor ſo well affected to it, as to try all experiments before they forſake it. There is, in the generality of men, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>parties</hi> and perſons they adhere
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95663:19"/>to, and in the <hi>mode</hi> of Worſhip they joyn in, which pleaſeth them, and has ſome part in their affections, as well as Religion it ſelf purely and abſtractly conſidered. And although ſuch <hi>collateral things</hi> are, in themſelves, not the beſt and higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to divine Worſhip; yet they are ſuch, as conſiderably prevail with not the leaſt part of mankind: And they are ſuch, as God in his providence over-rules, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve men in their open owning a <hi>Deity,</hi> and a viſible ſubjection to him, in ſome outward worſhip, and to prevent a total apoſtacy to Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>We may not unreaſonably ſuppoſe, that the reſtraint, which in ſome times paſt, was upon the uſe of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and the preſent worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to which the generality of the Nation were earneſtly inclined, did much occaſion that <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> which hath, too viſibly, infected many amongſt us. For, not being able to enjoy the way of worſhip they moſt liked, and wholly diſguſting the way that was then uſed in publick, 'tis to be feared that, in a ſhort time, many came, by that means, to throw off all thoughts of God; and, by a diſuſe of paying any homage or ſervice to him, came, at laſt, totally to deny him, and poſitively to diſpute againſt him.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95663:19"/>The great concern of a Chriſtian State is to juſtifie the <hi>common cauſe of God</hi> in the world, and to dam out the flood of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> Such, who can have no tye from <hi>above,</hi> and diſown all ſuperiour obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, are never to be ruled but by force. Religion ſhould be encouraged as that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal homage mankind ſtand obliged to pay to a Soveraign Being. Keeping men firm in their <hi>Religious Allegiance</hi> has a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary influence upon all humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He that is the faſteſt to God, will be the moſt dutiful ſubject, the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Citizen, and the ſafeſt friend. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to eradicate Religion, will be found alſo moſt pernicious and deſtructive to the State.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>The general revival of, and the great applauſe that hath, of late, been given to ſuch Philoſophical notions, as broadly and directly lead this way.</hi> Here the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> is moſt buſily at work, and drives on his greateſt trade. Though other things help men, firſt, to like <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and look after it, yet here is the great armoury for their defence; here they learn to juſtifie what before they reſolved to like. <hi>Democritus</hi> is better believed than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> in better credit with them than St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Whatever can be fetched
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95663:20"/>from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others to make good the worlds eternity, is greedily embraced: and all the notions of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> to make good the <hi>Hypotheſis of Atoms,</hi> are not only revived and juſtified, but improved, to the total denial of a God, in the height of all Atheiſtical principles, and maintained with ſo much ſeeming triumph over the reſt of the world, that he is thought a novice in knowledge, and an abſolute freſhman in the higheſt ſort of learning, that has not imbibed ſome of this kind of Philoſophy. The reaſons, or rather, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, upon which theſe things are grounded, I ſhall have occaſion enough to conſider hereafter. This account ought every where to be given of them; that as theſe two are the only projects, that have been yet found out by all the <hi>Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wits</hi> that have been in the world, to oppoſe the Being of God; ſo they are ſuch things as were by ſome very few men only firſt ſtarted, and found very little acceptance in thoſe times, wherein they firſt became publick: Nay, were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and confuted, by the generality of the ſobereſt and wiſeſt men then extant. 'Tis truly obſerved by a learned Author, that the firſt Atheiſm we hear of in the world, was in the moſt blind and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95663:20"/>age of <hi>Greece;</hi> when the <hi>obſcene Poets</hi> had ſo debauched the minds of the people, to believe ſuch monſtrous things of their Gods, that all, who were any way virtuous, muſt needs abhor ſuch Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and they became a deriſion to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent men. Then it was, (and not till then) that men began to ſet their wits on work, to <hi>ſolve the Phaenomena</hi> of nature without any Deity at all, and derive the world (in is original) from a <hi>fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> of an infinite company of little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which we call <hi>Atoms.</hi> Yet the very ſchool of <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf never quite ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the notion of a Deity: which made <hi>Cicero</hi> ſay of him, that he did <hi>nomine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> but <hi>re tollere Deos.</hi> His Diſciples in theſe daies have too far enlarged thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. It falls out now amongſt us (in an age declining from God, wherein ſuch things are by many moſt ſet by, that lead us fartheſt from him, and ſeem moſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us againſt him) that the ſcent of theſe things is freſhly and hotly purſued: and the <hi>Rabble</hi> of theſe notions, which have been ſo often routed, and have fled before the world, are now faced about, and afreſh recruited to aſſault this preſent Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:95663:21"/>
            <p>Theſe unhappy conjunctions, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, have conſpired to make this age a ſufferer from the <hi>worſt of enemies,</hi> and to hazard us upon the moſt dangerous Rock. Men have (according to their ſeveral intereſts and inclinations) come ſeveral waies to diſguſt Religion: and, out of many leſſer tracks, fallen at laſt into the broad road of Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>By this, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew you ſome fore-runners of this evil, and ſome of thoſe Harbingers that uſually prepare for it. I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you no longer in theſe <hi>Preliminaries,</hi> but apply my ſelf to that, where the greateſt concern of this undertaking lies.</p>
            <p>That the nobleſt ſearch of humane thoughts is after the firſt and higheſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will not be denied; and 'tis equally truc, that mans reaſoning faculty, in its due exerciſe, naturally ſteers him that way. He that finds himſelf in poſſeſſion of that great <hi>Luminary</hi> we call <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and that ſupreme endowment of reaſon, (by which he hath the aſcendant of all other viſible Beings, and maintains a ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over the reſt of the world) muſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95663:21"/>needs be led, by that, to lay cloſe ſiege to his <hi>own Being,</hi> and bethink himſelf round, how himſelf (as well as all other things) came firſt to be. 'Tis that lower principle of <hi>ſenſe</hi> that lies beneath, that reſts in the viſible exiſtence of things, and knows no more of them than that they are. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons motion lies in a higher Orb, and will not be denied to know <hi>why</hi> things are, as well as <hi>that</hi> they are; and <hi>how</hi> they came to be, as well as that they be. Such a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a reaſonable Being muſt needs make beyond the world; and ſo create to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſubject for his enquiry beyond what is viſibly ſeen, and made the common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his converſe. To ſee a man ruling himſelf and the reſt of the world by the <hi>freſh ſpringing up of thoughts,</hi> and the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his reaſon; and yet to ſuppoſe him to go no further in the extention of that faculty, than barely to improve things juſt as he finds them; and to take all things for granted therefore originally to <hi>be,</hi> only becauſe they now actually <hi>are:</hi> to ſearch ſo narrowly into every corner of nature, and yet to take the higheſt relation to things (which is the Being of them) for granted, were to put the higheſt abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the univerſal reaſon, and to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that large comprehenſive faculty
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95663:22"/>into a very mean exerciſe. The genuine tendency of a rational ſoul is ſtill to the utmoſt bounds of all enquiry; to know what is capable of being known, and to be aſcertained what cannot be known. As the ſatisfaction of reaſon is in its own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and can have no ſatisfaction but what it gives it ſelf; and takes pleaſure in all other things only as they are matter for that faculty to work upon; ſo the chiefeſt attainment <hi>reaſon</hi> muſt needs preſs after, is, to know its ſelf in its own original, and to know the <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> of that, which gives being to the knowledge of all other cauſes. Reaſon, in its actings, aims at a full comprehenſion, and a compleat knowledge of every thing it can conceive of: which is, to make every thing appear reaſonable to it; and ſo reduce it to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to it ſelf. All reaſonings of a man, about himſelf and all other things, muſt needs come ſhort of the ſatisfaction reaſon aims at, in making things anſwer the teſt of its exerciſe; and, at laſt, lie even to its own <hi>innate rectitude,</hi> unleſs it arrive at ſome acquieſcency, how it ſelf and all other things <hi>came to be,</hi> as well as that they be. He that <hi>thinks,</hi> or reaſons, muſt needs know, by that act, that he <hi>is:</hi> he needs no other demonſtration of his own
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95663:22"/>Being to himſelf; and with great eaſe, may he inform himſelf of the actual exiſtence of all other things. But the ſouls enquiry will ſtill reach further; the proper food of craving reaſon is a reaſonable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, ſuch as the ſubject is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. Reaſon travels to reduce things, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the truth of their exiſtence. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the reaſon of their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the right manner and method of their exiſtence, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to, and dependance upon each other. The <hi>whole truth</hi> of no exiſtence can be known, ſo as reaſon may juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a knowledge of it, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it, or elſe knowing there was <hi>no cauſe</hi> of it: becauſe the great and ſupreme diſtinction of <hi>Beings</hi> lies in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs and dependency of them. To know any viſible exiſtence to be <hi>without cauſe,</hi> is to know it to be that, which no man can rationally know any viſible Being to be: which is to know it to be eternal. And if it have ſome firſt cauſe, without ſome reaſonable account of that to our ſelves, we can never tell from what, nor from whence to date it; nor how to anſwer many other queſtions reaſon will aſk about it. Things are never in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtation, till they are made a right object
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95663:23"/>for knowledge, and reduced to a due cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to reaſon. Then they bear their proportion to the great and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal harmony. 'Tis reaſon puts the world into regular motion; ſorts each thing; places cauſes before effects; finds out cauſes by effects, and neceſſary conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from their own natural premiſes; and ſtill purſues things to the higheſt and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeſt cauſe</hi> of all. Search the world without this Candle, and it will appear nothing but a heap of confuſion. God ſeems to have placed this ſublime faculty in man, for two ends: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a man might rule himſelf, and the reſt of the world, in ſuch a manner and method, as might carry ſome proportion to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſon above, of which mans ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul is an image. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by the uſe of it he might aſcend to the knowledge of his Maker, and have every thing he ſaw, as well as himſelf, made a ſtep to help him upward. The ground of all our homage to God lies in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of a <hi>Supreme Being</hi> before us and above us: Without that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ever to introduce Religion into the world. Two things ſeem to be but a reaſonable collection from the natural compoſition of mankind, and the pure
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95663:23"/>iſſues of a reaſoning ſoul, abſtractly taken from all helps of revelation: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That 'tis not poſſible for that noble and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>faculty</hi> of mans reaſon to be true to it ſelf in its own actings, and to arrive at its own neceſſary ſatisfaction, about it ſelf and all other Beings, without a ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the primary reaſon and firſt cauſe of the Being of it ſelf and all other things. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of natural reaſon, in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, will ſafely conduct a man to the concluſion of ſome <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> and ſome one <hi>Supreme Being</hi> the cauſe of all Beings, which we call God. To prove there Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions undoubted truths, ſhall be the firſt endeavour of the following diſcourſe. If we can happily bring mankind to God by this high-way of their reaſon, and light a man to his Creator by this <hi>Lamp</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burns in his own ſoul, we ſhall then prove <hi>Atheiſm</hi> a very <hi>lye,</hi> and the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> a moſt unnatural <hi>lyer</hi> towards his God, and towards himſelf. I ſhall proceed, Firſt, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively</hi> and poſitively; and then nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, in giving a full anſwer to all the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> has to object.</p>
            <p>Conſider, in the firſt place, 'tis not a thing within any compaſs of ſuppoſition, that mankind in the uſe of their reaſon,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95663:24"/>ſhould fail to fix upon that as their firſt and great enquiry, <hi>how things came to be, in the poſture they are now found? and what ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal they owe themſelves to?</hi> That facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that reaſons about <hi>cauſes</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> muſt needs aſcend, by that method, to the higheſt cauſe of all things. No ſatisfying know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which the ſoul ſtill labours after, can be had of any thing, unleſs we can trace it to its <hi>original;</hi> without that, it proves but a vexation to reaſon, and reproaches it with ignorance, in that grand fundamental in the knowledge of things, which muſt give the trueſt inlet to all the ſubſequent comprehenſion we can have of them. That reaſon, in its operation, muſt needs move this way, will appear by theſe ſeveral conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There is no more obvious enquiry for whatever we ſee, than to know, whether it have a beginning, or were without a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> If it had beginning, when it did begin, and how it came firſt to exiſt in the world; and from whence it had the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it ſelf. No mans reaſon can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, without ſome anſwer to this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Finding out the original of things, determines the property of them;</hi> and ſo fills the mind with a ſatisfaction in that great concern reaſon has about every
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95663:24"/>thing, to know <hi>whoſe</hi> it is. Whatever was the firſt cauſe of a thing, and the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal maker of it, muſt needs have the property of it. 'Tis impoſſible there ſhould be a claim made, with ſo much ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to any thing, as by the firſt maker of it. 'Tis not poſſible to diſſeize him of his right to a thing, that gave it its exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and cauſed it firſt to be. He that firſt produced a Being, had that Being firſt entirely exiſting in himſelf, and in his own power. Whatever is made, can have no property in it ſelf: The right muſt needs be in the maker. Here reaſon ſits down ſatisfied, and fully acquieſces in that particular.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The knowing the original of any thing, gives us the true boundaries and limits of it.</hi> Nothing can riſe higher than its original. No effect can out-reach the cauſe. Nay, there muſt be ever a neceſſary <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority</hi> in whatever is <hi>cauſed,</hi> to the firſt <hi>cauſer</hi> of it. This is a neceſſary direction to all the ſearches of reaſon about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any thing, to know the firſt <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſuch a Being, and the true <hi>original</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives it ſelf from.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The knowledge of things in their</hi> prima cauſa <hi>quiets our reaſon, becauſe it gives us the utmoſt and ultimate knowledge
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95663:25"/>that is to be had about them.</hi> To know a thing in it ſelf, and to know it in its <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> and <hi>original,</hi> is to know <hi>all</hi> that reaſon can expect to know about any viſible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This brings things to hold their due proportion to the rational ſoul; and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us in our knowledge, in placing <hi>cauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>effects</hi> in their due Stations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the being of reaſon be ſuch as that it muſt neceſſarily make out it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into ſuch enquiries; and that the firſt cauſe of things is the moſt proper object for a rational ſoul that trades in cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, we will thus proceed.</p>
            <p>Every thing in this world muſt either be cauſed by it ſelf, or be without cauſe, or elſe be cauſed by ſomething that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and is above it ſelf. The two firſt are not only improbable, but utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: and therefore the truth muſt needs lie in the laſt.</p>
            <p>For the firſt; The <hi>rudeſt Non-ſenſe</hi> that can impoſe it ſelf upon any mans reaſon, is to ſay, <hi>that any thing ever cauſed or mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it ſelf.</hi> 'Tis to make every thing its own God, and to cut u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by the roots all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and dependency of one thing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95663:25"/>upon another. For, were all things equally cauſed by themſelves, they muſt needs be equal in their ſuperiority, becauſe equal in their independency. 'Tis likewiſe to make a thing impoſſible to have an end; for what once made it ſelf, can, by the ſame influence, eternally make it ſelf. If any thing were once the reaſon of it ſelf, it may be ever ſo: nor would any thing ever ceaſe to be, that had a power to preſerve its own Being. But beſides all this, there is this further abſurdity never to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to ſay thing made it ſelf, is to ſay, it did <hi>act</hi> before it <hi>was,</hi> and did ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate before it had an exiſtence; and that it did the higheſt thing to it ſelf (which was to cauſe and make it ſelf) before it was it ſelf. The loweſt ſort of reaſon wears in <hi>antipathy</hi> to ſuch an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The world could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe:</hi> For then it muſt be what 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould be, which is eternal. For cauſes and effects (of which the world conſiſts) own themſelves to a firſt cauſe, and neceſſarily ſuppoſe <hi>time</hi> and <hi>priority</hi> in time. The cauſe naturally precedes the effect. They muſt have time to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in. Cauſes and effects (that are, in ſuch exiſtence, neceſſarily conjoyned) muſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95663:26"/>needs ceaſe to that denomination in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſo ceaſe to be what they really are: and therefore are impoſſible to be eternal; if one be eternal, the other muſt needs be ſo too. And 'tis evident, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe, and an eternal effect is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity. Now that the world could not be eternal (and ſo conſequently without cauſe) may thus appear. If the world be <hi>eternal,</hi> 'tis plain and undeniable, it muſt ever have been in the poſture that now it is: and that is utterly impoſſible; for the poſture the world is now in, is a courſe of generation and corruption; and ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption muſt as well have been eternal as generation. And thence 'twill evidently follow, that things that do generate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt muſt have eternally been, and <hi>eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not</hi> have been. If the world have been from everlaſting, then the preſent ſtate of the world in the propagation of it ſelf, muſt needs have been ſo too. The preſent way of <hi>generation,</hi> and a ſucceſſion in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, muſt needs have been everlaſting too. For if the world be eternal, though individual perſons and Beings ceaſe, and new come in their places; yet the general round and courſe of the world, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it ſelf, muſt needs have been the ſame for ever. But to conceive that, is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95663:26"/>directly to oppoſe our own reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: becauſe we find daily, that the way by which the world is now propagated and upheld, could not have eternally been, but plainly points us to ſome original cauſe we ſee not. For if the <hi>Hen</hi> be produced by the <hi>Egg,</hi> and that <hi>Egg</hi> produced by a <hi>Hen,</hi> and the propagation of both run in ſuch a circle; common reaſon tells us, there muſt be ſome firſt <hi>Hen,</hi> or ſome firſt <hi>Egg</hi> to ſet that way of generation on work, or elſe it could never have been. As 'tis in <hi>motion;</hi> there muſt be ſome firſt mover, or elſe an innate and ſelf-originated principle of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if there be an innate ſelf-originated principle of motion, then whatſoever ſo moves, can never ceaſe to move; if not, there can never be motion without a firſt mover. We ſee nothing but what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſomewhat elſe: and therefore muſt rationally conclude, there muſt be ſome firſt producer. The whole world can ſhew us the beginning, originally, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo as to ſatisfie our reaſon about it: and yet, in its whole conſtitution, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably fathers it ſelf upon ſome firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Our reaſon therefore compels us to look out to ſome <hi>ſupreme Beginning,</hi> that gave the firſt riſe to all things we ſee, and ſet them firſt on work. A man
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95663:27"/>begets a man, and that man was begotten by another man; but where is the firſt man, to beget, that was not begotten, nor brought forth in the common way of Generation? For ſuch, our reaſon tells us, by this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible courſe of propagating the world, there muſt needs have been. 'Tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (in the way we ſee men begotten) there ſhould ever have been any men in the world without ſome firſt man. Our reaſon is loſt in the circiel of one mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting another, without ſome <hi>firſt man</hi> that was not begotten. 'Tis non-ſenſe to ſay, that one man begat another from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; becauſe that one mans begetting another, directly relates to time, beginning and priority, which are all perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the notion of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be originated there. Sometimes <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, there muſt be a firſt cauſe, and that infinity of cauſes is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous abſurdity. Either the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt confeſs, that this courſe of generation does point us to ſome firſt riſe and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and cannot be ſuppoſed, by out reaſon, to be without it: and then there muſt be ſome <hi>firſt man,</hi> that muſt begin the natural way of propagating mankind; and that <hi>firſt man</hi> could not be begotten by any other; for then he could not be the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95663:27"/>firſt; for that rule is true, <hi>primo non eſt prius;</hi> and if ſo, that firſt man muſt either cauſe himſelf, or be cauſed by ſomething above and before himſelf; to ſay the firſt, I have ſhewed is an abſolute contradiction; to ſay the latter, is to bring us regularly to God. If the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> denies that there <hi>was any beginning of things, or any firſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> but ſaies, that <hi>the world is eternal, and the way of its generation is eternal like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;</hi> I ſhall plainly refute him, as rendring himſelf groſly abſurd, and that ſeveral waies. Firſt, he begs a thing for granted to be, and muſt take it ſo to be, which he never ſaw, nor can have any aſſurance of. The eternity of the world, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion eternal of generation and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not only unreaſonable for any man to believe, but impoſſible for any man to know. 'Tis unreaſonable to believe, becauſe our ſelves, and all we converſe with, have a <hi>viſible beginning</hi> and ending, and manner of production; which directly fathers it ſelf upon ſome firſt beginning, and could not have its riſe from eternity. For whatever begins and ends, to ſay it was eternal in that courſe, is to ſay plainly, there was eternal beginning, and eternal ending; which is to affirm a moſt ridiculous contradiction. And 'tis as impoſſible for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95663:28"/>any man to <hi>know,</hi> unleſs he knew himſelf eternal: and then he muſt know himſelf to be (which is impoſſible) contrary to what he really is: or elſe there muſt have been ſome <hi>eternal Tradiction,</hi> from one to another, of the worlds eternity, which neither <hi>is,</hi> nor ever yet <hi>was.</hi> But the cleareſt and moſt undeniable proof, that the world, in its preſent being, could not be eternal, (which it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have been, if it be eternal) will thus ariſe. The viſible way by which the world is carried on, is by a courſe of generation and corruption: but ſuch a courſe is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be eternal; and that for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Generation and corruption ſuppoſe an uneven ſucceſſion, a riſing and falling;</hi> which is impoſſible in that which is eternal; for that which is properly eternal is incapable of bounds, and includes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nireneſs in its intrinſick and formal reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And where things are infinite, there can be no cadencies in the manner of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. And this regulates their operation For all things act and work according to their Being and manner of exiſtence. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:95663:28"/>be ſaid to do, they muſt infinitely be, and infinitely not be, which is plainly deſtructive to an Eternal Being; yea, to any Being at all. Again, whatſoever is infinite, muſt needs be perfect; and <hi>evenly</hi> ſo, becauſe it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely</hi> ſo. If there were an infinite ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in generation, no generable matter could ever be deficient, or ever miſs in its proper generation: which experience dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews us it does. If all the generable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the generable quality be infinite, which it muſt be, if there be infinity in generation) them they muſt perpetually continue the ſame <hi>operation</hi> without a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of failing in their proper kind. The truth of this will thus appear; either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in its quality, was infinitely perfect, or <hi>not;</hi> if you ſay <hi>not,</hi> you make <hi>imperfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> which cannot be; if it were, then it muſt needs <hi>continue</hi> ſo; there can never be any miſcarriage in generation, where gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is <hi>infinite.</hi> That which did infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly operate <hi>any</hi> way, muſt needs perfectly operate <hi>that</hi> way; and ſo infallibly continue to operate the ſame way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>VVhatever is ſuppoſed infinite, muſt be ſuppoſed entirely compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Nothing that is imperfect can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; for you muſt then ſuppoſe, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>all</hi> that is infinite is imperfect, or <hi>part</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95663:29"/>of it. If all, then there could never have been any thing perfect in any kind; for whatſoever <hi>is</hi> (if you ſuppoſe infinite) muſt needs be whatever <hi>was,</hi> or elſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from whatever was. If part only be <hi>imperfect,</hi> then infiniteneſs muſt be divided into perfection and imperfection, which is impoſſible. For whereſoever there is infiniteneſs, there muſt needs be <hi>identity</hi> Whatſoever had an infinite <hi>Being,</hi> muſt needs have a perfect Being; becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever did infinitely exiſt, has the higheſt perfection of Being: for infinitely to be, is the higheſt perfection of <hi>Being;</hi> and where that higheſt intrinſick perfection of <hi>Being</hi> is, it neceſſarily ſwallows up all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection into it ſelf, and there can never be wanting any lower perfection belonging to Being.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95663:29"/>aſhes, I am ſure the form and compoſition of the ſtick is diſſolved; and when a <hi>Candle</hi> expires into ſmoke, and that ſmoke into Air, the form of the Candle, and the being of it, as a Candle, is gone. I leave ſuch to find out all the ſame individual parts of the <hi>ſtick</hi> in the <hi>Aſhes,</hi> and all the wax and the thred of the Candle in the ſmoke of it, who tell you they are there, but lie in <hi>ſmall Maſſes, and firſt Concretions, that are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by the moſt acute ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Atheiſt will, here, no way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage himſelf, by the objection he uſually makes: which is this; ſaies he, <hi>When any thing corrupts, the matter of which that thing was made, ſtill remains: 'tis the form and compoſition of that thing, that is only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and ſo annihilated; the world loſeth nothing of the matter it had in it before, by ſuch corruption</hi> — Let the Atheiſt have all this granted, yet it no way conduceth to his purpoſe. For I will aſk him but this queſtion, <hi>How was the matter of the world infinitely exiſting?</hi> If it were infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in this way of generating and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting particular forms, then he falls flat with the ſtroke of this argument; for then the world muſt needs be <hi>infinitely beginning,</hi> and <hi>infinitely ending,</hi> which is the height of contradiction; and (in all viſible forms
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95663:30"/>and beings, of which the world conſiſts) infinitely ſomething, and infinitely nothing. For it was infinitely generating them, and infinitely corrupting them; for corrupting is a part of the world, as well as genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and where the whole is infinite, all the parts muſt needs be infinite too: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that general maxim agreed by all <hi>Philoſophers, that all the parts of an infinite are infinite.</hi> If this generating matter of the world did infinitely exiſt before it did ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in generation and corruption, then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and corruption had a time when they were not: and ſo are not infinite. Nor is the world, then, <hi>eternal;</hi> for it has not then, ever been, in the poſture it now is. This lies plain againſt the <hi>Atheiſt;</hi> let him take the matter of the world to be in what kind of compoſition he will: either with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and thoſe of his way, who ſay; the Elements, when they make up a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, loſe themſelves, and are diſſolved, both in ſubſtance and quality, into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what they conſtitute, which is not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Or elſe with thoſe of the <hi>Atomical</hi> way, who ſay, that the <hi>particles</hi> of things are, in all mixtures of humane nature, only <hi>appoſed</hi> each to other, without any loſs of their own proper natures; either way, the thing formed, in the form and compoſition
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95663:30"/>of it, by corruption, totally <hi>nulled</hi> and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a ſucceſſion of the world by generation and corruption, could never be infinite, <hi>becauſe it neceſſarily ſuppoſeth priority and poſteriority.</hi> Nay, 'tis viſible to our ſenſes and our reaſon, that it has <hi>priority</hi> and <hi>poſteriority</hi> in it: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long purely and peculiarly to <hi>time,</hi> and cannot be applied to what is infinite. To ſay, that two things that depend each upon other, and cauſe each other, are both eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in that caſuality, is abſurd; becauſe, in ſuch a <hi>caſuality,</hi> they could not be both at one time, which all eternal things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily are. We ſee, by our common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that a thing cannot corrupt in one form, and generate into another, at one and the ſame time. If it ſhould do ſo, and that courſe were eternal, it will unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow, that the world (as to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated Beings) was infinitely ſomething, and infinitely nothing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Things that everlaſtingly were, could never come under any confinement or regulation of time. Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> diſcourſes largely of this: [things that were eternally ſo, could never come under the mutations and changes of time; which we ſee all things now do. 'Tis time brings
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95663:31"/>into corruption, and time brings into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Whatever was eternal <hi>à parte ante,</hi> muſt need be ſo <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> and run an even and uninterrupted courſe. An eternal thing can never be ſtopt by time.] If, to evade this, the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will ſay, that every thing ſtill is as it ever and eternally was, (which he muſt ſay) then plainly he affirms, that time and all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, viciſſitudes, and effects of it, are eternal too; for if all things, now ſubject to the regulament of time, were everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſo, then time muſt needs be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too; which is to come to the dregs of all contradiction.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Whatever is eternal can never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its ſelf, nor its own form, nor be ſubject to alteration.</hi> Becauſe whatever did eternally exiſt, did neceſſarily exiſt as it eternally was; all eternal things muſt needs be <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> If matter abſtracted from generation were eternal, it could then never alter it ſelf, and come into the round of generation and corruption: For then 'twere not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. If matter be ſaid to be eternal in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and corruption, the anſwer has been given, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be both eternal; for then they muſt be both exiſting together: which is a contradiction; as much as to ſay, a thing <hi>is,</hi> and is <hi>not,</hi> at
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95663:31"/>the ſame time. Generation of one Being by corruption of another ſuppoſeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Being precedent to it. Corruption of <hi>one Being,</hi> produceth the generation of another. But 'tis utterly impoſſible, that any Being (that ever was eternally a Being) ſhould ever turn into corruption, and ſo ceaſe to be ſuch a Being in time, as it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally had been. And if matter, abſtracted from Beings and Forms in ſuch a way, were eternally matter, it muſt needs eternally ſo continue.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>If the world be eternal, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly have in it ſelf any inherent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſique defect about its being ſo.</hi> That is, a thing cannot be imagined to have ſo, that is eternal; eſpecially a direct relation to an original, which is deſtructive to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternity. Whatſoever is <hi>eternal,</hi> muſt need carry an evidence paſt queſtion, of its entire exiſting by it ſelf; becauſe what is eternal muſt needs have perfection in its exiſtence, and be totally <hi>independent</hi> from all other things in reference to its own Being. But the world it ſelf confutes all imaginable <hi>Atheiſm</hi> about this point; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, while we look no further than the world for it ſelf, we are at a perfect loſs for a firſt cauſe, and a firſt mover in every thing. The world (in this viſible defect)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95663:32"/>is its own <hi>negative</hi> to its own eternity; for whatſoever I can, with any good reaſon imagine eternal, I muſt ſee to be withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

So that this maxim de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the main queſtion no way; but may be an appurtenant to it, and very well <hi>ſolved</hi> either way.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95663:34"/>
            <p>Having thus endeavoured to make thoſe two firſt things propoſed evident; Firſt, <hi>That things could not make or cauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> And that the <hi>world could never be its own original.</hi> And Secondly, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world, nor the whole of the world it ſelf, could be without cauſe, and ſo be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> I ſhall proceed to prove the third thing propoſed, which was, <hi>that the world was cauſed by ſomething before it and above it:</hi> and that there is one ſupreme eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we call <hi>GOD,</hi> that did cauſe and make the world. And this I make good ſeveral waies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The univerſal agreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that has been amongſt mankind, in all places, times, and ages, in this matter,</hi> all concurring in the exiſtence of a Deity, ſtrongly affirms this. Where was there (by record of experience) any people, in any Nation under the Sun, found, that did not pay ſome homage to the notion of a <hi>Deity?</hi> Where did ever avowed <hi>Atheiſm</hi> poſſeſs any part of the world, or fix its habitation? The whole world have ever ſubſcribed their ſubjection to a ſuperiour Being. All the Idolatry and Polythiſm, that has been in the world, has been founded in this; for, though their worſhip hath not been rightly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95663:34"/>directed, and their homage not regularly paid where it became due, yet this general principle ſtill lay uppermoſt in the ſpirits of mankind; <hi>[That a worſhip was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and a homage to be paid, to ſomewhat that was before them, and is above them.]</hi> You may as ſoon find a Nation without their ſouls, as without their Gods. Nay, they would ſet up a <hi>Leek,</hi> an <hi>Onion,</hi> a <hi>Calf,</hi> or an <hi>Oxe,</hi> or any creature to ſubject themſelves to a ſupreme Deity by; and make it a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> to vent that preſſing ſenſe of a ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>ſomewhat above them,</hi> rather than not do it. Men would have an Altar to an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God,</hi> rather than none: which, when they had nothing viſible, declares a pure innate principle to ſomewhat above them. They were ſo filled with ſuch an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they would have a Deity for <hi>every thing:</hi> for their corn and their wine, and every thing they dealt with. The <hi>Romans,</hi> by that method, had multiplied their Gods to above <hi>thirty thouſand:</hi> and other Nations not much behind them. Which can ſpeak no other thing unto us, than that men ſaw ſomewhat of a Deity in themſelves and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe, under whoſe rule and diſpoſe all things lay ſubjected, and in whom they lived, and moved, and had their being. Nor would they undertake any thing, in peace or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95663:35"/>war, private or publick, without a previous application to a Deity: whoſe right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, and all their actions, they did thereby fully own and aſſent to. If we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the true and primary grounds of this, we ſhall find them to lie in three things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The univerſal exerciſe of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of mankind, about themſelves and all they ſaw in the world, neceſſarily fixed in them this concluſion, <hi>That there muſt be a first Cauſe, and a ſupreme beginner of things:</hi> The general reaſon of the world has concenter'd in this, and proceeded upon it as an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>maxim,</hi> agreeing to the truth of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>All mankind live and exiſt with an inſtinct of a Deity in their very nature and being.</hi> A God runs in the veins and blood of men. So ſaith <hi>Cicero; In omnium animis Deorum notionem impreſſit ipſa Natura, De N. Deor. l.</hi> 1. We have diſcovered parts of the world, where men have lived without clothes, and without moſt humane circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that attend mankind; but never any without ſome God. God has ſtamped a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of himſelf upon us in our very make. He has <hi>made us in his own image:</hi> We can never run away from <hi>that,</hi> no more than we can take leave of our ſelves, and ſhake hands with our own Beings. Whatever God, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95663:35"/>wiſe Maker has made, they carry the marks of him about them. But to man eſpecially he has ſecured his claim, in his very <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> Nor is this a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition begged and taken for granted (like an <hi>Atheiſts Hipotheſis</hi>) but a thing evidently ſo. The fears and hopes of all men are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided to ſomewhat above them. When men are in <hi>danger,</hi> they, naturally, run to their God. Man, in all his fears and ſorrows, naturally ſhelters himſelf under a ſupreme Being above him. He ſoon finds himſelf at the utmoſt confines of his own protection: but ſits not down there; ſtill looks further and higher. The workings of his ſoul (as well as the form of his body) are ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; they have a divine tendency. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities are this truth's opportunities. Though the <hi>Atheiſts diſpute,</hi> yet he cannot, ſometimes, forbear to <hi>tremble.</hi> The notion of a Deity has made mankind, in all ages, fall before it. Would the Atheiſt be but ſo true to himſelf as to confeſs it, his own fears, ſometimes, confute his unbelief, and his own unavoidable practice forbids his principles, When the meſſengers of death come to treat with him, they will bring him <hi>tidings of another world;</hi> and awaken him with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of that Deity, he has ſo mock'd at. If there were nothing beyond this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95663:36"/>world, and on the other ſide the grave, mens thoughts of futurity were very vain: and the trouble of moſt men were eaſily cured; they might not only poſſibly, but eaſily, make themſelves what they ſeem to be, and what they have really a mind to be.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another ground of this may be reaſonably ſuppoſed to be, <hi>an univerſal tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition amongſt men, not only of Gods making the world, but of Gods ſometimes appearing to, and converſing with the world.</hi> Which he hath often done, and given a witneſs to himſelf that way. We may not only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imagine it a thing to have been, but we cannot, with any good reaſon, imagine it not to have been, that ſuch things ſhould not be told from one to another, and run in a channel of univerſal tradition. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, but that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> told the ſtory of the worlds original to their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And three men might carry it far: <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived with <hi>Adam</hi> 243 years; <hi>Sem</hi> lived with <hi>Methuſelah</hi> 98 years before the flood; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> lived 50 years with <hi>Shem</hi> after the flood; and died but 10 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people went into <hi>Egypt.</hi> God has often made himſelf known to the world. And not only the thing it ſelf, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, muſt needs be a thing of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the ſtory of it could never die
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95663:36"/>in a whiſper. <hi>Sacrificing</hi> was a thing God revealed, in a ſupernatural way, to <hi>Adam;</hi> and we ſee the whole world filled with the practice of it, by the tradition of it from him: for it was ſpread all the world over in ſuch places, where it could not be received from the practice and inſtitution of it amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> afterwards. Sacrifices in themſelves muſt needs be ſupernatural, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are purely relating to Chriſt: and ſo muſt needs be revealed from God; and could not be ſuch a thing, as <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt ſhould invent and find out by natural light; and all the world ſhould, by the ſame, afterwards agree in, as a way of worſhip, and a thing acceptable to God. Though in after ages (as uſually it fares with tradition) the manner and circumſtances of things, by their often relation, might be varied and worn out: yet that main thing [that there was a God, and that he had ſometimes, in an eſpecial manner, made it known to ſome part of the world, that there was ſo] was likely to be permanent <hi>in all generations.</hi> And yet tradition was another thing in thoſe times, when (as learned men obſerve) three men, <hi>Methuſelah, Shem</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a tradition from the Creation of the world, till within ten years of the people of <hi>Iſraels</hi> going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95663:37"/>was very many hundreds of years.</p>

               </gap> deny it; and that ſpoils the <hi>univerſality</hi> of it. <hi>Secondly, This fear of a Deity (which, you ſay, the world is ſo poſſeſſed withall) is nothing but what ſome cunning men have foiſted into the world, upon politick grounds,</hi> and the better to ſerve their own turns, and keep the world in ſubjection and awe.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> How little does it weigh down the oppoſite ſcale to this weighty truth? If there be ſome <hi>Ideots,</hi> and ſome mad men in the world, ſhall not mankind be denominated <hi>rational?</hi> If there be ſome <hi>Torys</hi> and <hi>Moſs-Troopers,</hi> and ſuch who will come under no government; were it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable therefore to ſay, that <hi>government</hi> is not ſuch a thing as the world have agreed in, and an inſtitution univerſally founded in natural light? Though ſome men are born blind, yet <hi>eye-ſight,</hi> I hope, is univerſal. Were it any way reaſonable to be endured, that the plaineſt demonſtrable Propoſition in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> ſhould be denied to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true all the world over, becauſe ſome men will deny it? which, if mens civil
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95663:37"/>intereſts, and worldly concerns were as much engaged about, as they are about other things, there is no doubt but they would; and be as poſitive and vehement in their negation, as they are in denying other things, meerly becauſe they would not have them to be. If this objection were of any force, 'twere in the power of any men (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſottiſhly ignorant, or perverſely peeviſh) to deny the univerſality of any, the plaineſt, either moral or divine truth, when either they <hi>cannot,</hi> or <hi>will not</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. The univerſality of any thing does not lie in every individual perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it: it depends not upon indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual aſſents; but in that even and true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion it bears to the <hi>univerſal reaſon</hi> of the world; and ſo it incorporates it ſelf into the univerſal principle that rules the world. Whatever is, in it ſelf, truly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, is univerſally reaſonable, becauſe reaſon is univerſal. Let never ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that <hi>three angles, in a triangle, are equal to two right angles,</hi> or never ſo few under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; yet 'tis an univerſal truth, and muſt be ſo acknowledged. No abſurd thing could ever come into the world, but that it has ſome Authors. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4. tells us, there were ſome that affirmed, <hi>A thing might be, and might not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95663:38"/>be, at the ſame time.</hi> Did that any way overthrow the generality of that maxim in reaſon [that nothing could be, and could not be, at the ſame time?] <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his book <hi>de natura Deorum,</hi> has long ſince told us, that <hi>nothing could be ſo abſurd that had not ſome Philoſopher for its Patron.</hi> That we call univerſal conſent in mankind, muſt not be built upon every individual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for then 'twere in the power of any one man, never ſo fooliſh or corrupt, to overthrow it; and conſidering the various defects and intereſts of mankind, there could never be any ſuch thing. Nor ought we, with any good reaſon, to denominate univerſal from every particular; unleſs every particular man in the world were infallible in his judgement. If ever there were ſuch a thing in the world as univerſal conſent to any thing, (wherein mens <hi>intereſts</hi> lay vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concern'd) it has been in this caſe. It was never any man intereſt to deny, that two and two make four: but it has been, and is mens corrupt intereſt, to deny <hi>there is a God;</hi> that ſo they might live as they liſt. But yet, notwithſtanding that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God and Religion has curb'd men in their appetite, and been directly oppoſite to their inclinations; yet it has prevailed in the world with an univerſality <hi>ſuperlative</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:95663:38"/>to what any one thing can pretend to. How will the Atheiſt ſpeed by trying his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the world, if he denies univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Either he muſt go to the <hi>major part,</hi> or the <hi>melior part.</hi> If to the <hi>major</hi> part, he has millions againſt an individual; If to the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior</hi> part, all the religious, juſt, righteous men, that have ever been, refer to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rectitude in a deity, and have been an united party, ſince the world began, againſt him.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond Objection, [that this fear of a Deity in men is a thing <hi>artificially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into them, upon politick grounds, the better to keep them in ſubjection;</hi> and is a lye impoſed upon the world.]</p>
            <p>The Anſwer lies eaſie. Firſt, This muſt be ſaid to it; 'tis a thing begged and taken for granted, without the leaſt <hi>probation</hi> in any ſort. The Atheiſt is wholly preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in it. After what manner was this <hi>cheat</hi> put upon the world? and at what time? and where are the authors of it? who ever gave any account of thoſe things? and no man could ever know them to be a <hi>cheat,</hi> but he muſt be able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them to himſelf and others. Is it a thing likely, or to be credited, that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95663:39"/>
               <hi>cheat</hi> ſhould bow down the backs of all mankind? and induce ſo many doubts, and fears, and troubles amongſt them, and give an interruption to the whole courſe of their corrupt living, and that there ſhould be no account of it? That they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcover it? Nor make enquiry into it? But that it ſhould be every where ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and taken as a thing granted? Let me aſk the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> this queſtion: Where is there to be found a man, that does not carry this very fear about himſelf, which, he ſays, was impoſed as a <hi>cheat</hi> upon others? when he can find me a man, that has, at no time, and upon no occaſion, any <hi>fear about</hi> him, ariſing from <hi>ſomewhat above him;</hi> I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that man was capable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to put it as a <hi>cheat</hi> upon another. But if he felt it himſelf, and his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience made it a truth to himſelf, he could never intend it as a cheat to another. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there muſt be a general concurrence in all parts of the world, to ſet this <hi>cheat</hi> on foot: and it muſt univerſally take, and have the ſame ſucceſs in every place, and with all ſorts of perſons. For we find this fear of a God in every place where we go: And yet a vaſt number of places have been found out in the world, that never converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any other people, nor received any
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95663:39"/>kind of manners or principles from them. Religion is, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and the <hi>Civilians</hi> ſay truly, <hi>The general and univerſal Law of Nations.</hi> The moſt barbarous people in the world have often made Laws to put ſuch to death as denied all Religion. 'Tis boaſted of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> by that poetical <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Lucretius,</hi> that he was the firſt that oppoſed Religion, and affronted the Gods. If he were ſo, then it ſeems, they had the univerſal and quiet poſſeſſion of the world before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will needs have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>that Religion came firſt into the world by ſome accidental FRIGHT:</hi> and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men improved that, to make men believe there was ſomewhat above them. When men heard it <hi>thunder,</hi> and were afraid, then they were told, that there was ſome body above, that was angry, and ſpake loud; and ſo they were cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened into a belief of a Deity—But I would the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> would conſider, that if the notion of a Deity had been built only upon ſuch a foundation, it would ſoon have fallen. For when men came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the natural cauſe of <hi>thunder,</hi> they would have abhorred ſuch a <hi>cheat,</hi> and deteſted and ſcorned the notion of a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95663:40"/>God, ten times the more. 'Twas the true fear of a Deity upon which all other things have operated. If men had not found it, they could never have made it. Men may miſlead it, but could never generally create it.</p>
            <p>But that which ought to fix us in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfaction in this matter, and to prove thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grand Objection of the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> to be moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> abſurd; and that Religion, and the fear of a Deity could never be a <hi>cheat</hi> impoſed upon the world; is, that it lies directly oppoſite to common reaſon to believe, that ſuch a thing as Religion ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, as the higheſt and moſt ſupreme concern of the world, and to which all others were to yield; and to which all mens inclinations (though they lay direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to it) were to bow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, that had neither any <hi>rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations</hi> externally to approve it ſelf by, to the reaſon of men, nor, at firſt, found any principles within them that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined them to ſuch a thing. The Atheiſt falls (in his objection) under this unavoidable <hi>dilemma.</hi> Either Religion had good reaſons, and ſome real grounds firſt to induce it, or it had not; if it had, then 'twas a real and true thing, and the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95663:40"/>world was no way abuſed in it; and the Atheiſt is gone in his objection. If it had not, (which by the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> principles, it had not: for, if there be no God, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have any) then you muſt believe, that all mankind ſuffered a notion to reign over them moſt croſs and oppoſite to their inclinations, that had not the leaſt truth in it, nor the leaſt thing belonging to it, that could give it any reaſonable probation; nor had, at the firſt, any natural innate intereſt in mens minds (but quite the contrary) to give it any (much leſs a total and general) reception amongſt men. He that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this might poſſibly be, muſt, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, believe that <hi>mankind is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional;</hi> nor that the world has ſuch a thing as reaſon that governs it, for 'tis to believe the world to ſwallow a thing as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that has not the leaſt evidence of reaſon to be given of it. Whatſoever <hi>cheat</hi> mankind could attempt one upon another, muſt be by the uſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and 'tis not to be imagined that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could invent a cheat that reaſon ſhould not diſcover; and that a thing falſe ſhould be made (by the help of reaſon) ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly true, that reaſon, at one time or other, ſhould not be able to detect it. For, Firſt there is the univerſal reaſon of all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95663:41"/>perſons and all ages againſt ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mens reaſon: and then, there is a lie to be proved, and that to be made appear true and reaſonable (which is not in the leaſt ſo) by ſome private mens reaſon, againſt the reaſon of the whole world; that is, ſome few men muſt be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world there is a God; which (upon the Atheiſts principles) they could not only never ſhew them, but never be able to give them any rational account, by any <hi>effects on operations</hi> of him, that there was ſuch a thing, And gain an univerſal aſſent to it.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, ſome men muſt tell the world, for their own private advantage, that there was a God; and the whole world muſt ſtraight be frighted with it, and believe it; and beget their children, and their children beget others again, and ſo on, with the ſame <hi>fright,</hi> and belief of what they never ſaw, nor had the leaſt ground reaſonably to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Where is the man that can ſhew, that the world ever yet had a <hi>publick cheat</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted upon it, but that in the ſame age it was contradicted, and the cheat made manifeſt? Take it in <hi>Mahumetaniſm,</hi> or whatever you will. If there be no God, the ground of all Religion in fact is falſe; and all the deductions from it, miſtakes and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95663:41"/>Non-ſenſe. He that will ſide with the Atheiſt, and befriend him in this, muſt imagine that ſome (we know not who, in ages paſt all records, we know not when) ſhould, upon the account of their own private ends, be able to befool the whole world; and introduce a thing as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt part of the world, that had no reality in it, and ſo could not have the leaſt reaſonable account given of it; and yet that the whole world ſhould receive it, and ſubmit to it. He that can embrace this foppery, and believe it, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt to make him confeſs, againſt <hi>Euclide [That a part is greater than the whole;]</hi> and bring him to juſtifie the higheſt <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> that abſurdity it ſelf can attain to.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Argument to conduct us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and to prove that he made the world, ſhall be this; <hi>The natural rectitude, and innate harmony of the world;</hi> and the due ſubornation of things one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the whole of the world; all things concentring in one common end. This muſt needs come from an eternal rectitude, and a ſupreme Director, the wiſeſt of all workmen and contrivers, if you admit cauſes ſuperiour to effect.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95663:42"/>Can you perſwade your reaſon, that the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars were by <hi>chance</hi> fixed in the Firmament? and that they do by <hi>chance</hi> keep a conſtant uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted courſe? and make conſtant day and night, and a certain fixed determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all times and ſeaſons? Can the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> (without impudent madneſs) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf, that <hi>Seed-time</hi> and <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and all the regular ſubordination of things one to another, in their proper uſes and dependencies, are owing to nothing but <hi>chance?</hi> Either they were ſo eternally, or ſo in time. If eternally, they could not be by chance; for <hi>chance cannot be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> for whatſoever was eternally ſo, could have no poſſibility of chance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould be ſo, or not ſo. <hi>Chance</hi> is a fiction, a <hi>phantaſm,</hi> a thing without a real Being: there is no ſuch thing as chance, ever was, or can be, either in things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or eternal. A thing that is by chance muſt be ſuch a thing as comes to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the neceſſary enforcement of any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cauſe: A thing that might have been, or might not have been, or might any way have been otherwiſe than it is. But there is no ſuch thing now in the world; and whatever was eternally ſo, was ever ſo, and without a poſſibility of ever being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95663:42"/>ſo, or of ever being not ſo. If they come to be ſo in time, they muſt either make themſelves ſo, or be made ſo: <hi>make themſelves ſo,</hi> I have proved already, they could not; nothing can be the original cauſe of it ſelf; and therefore they muſt needs be made ſo; and if <hi>made ſo,</hi> then they could not come by <hi>chance to be ſo.</hi> Becauſe the world conſiſting of cauſes and effects, one thing ſtill cauſing another, and nothing without cauſe, there muſt neceſſarily and naturally be a cauſe of theſe cauſes; and whatſoever cauſed theſe cauſes, muſt needs be a cauſe, and the higheſt cauſe. If the world were ever cauſed by any thing but it ſelf, it could never be by <hi>chance;</hi> becauſe whatſover cauſeth any thing, deſtroyes the being of it by <hi>chance.</hi> For if it had a cauſe, there was a reaſon why it came to paſs; and if there were a reaſon why it came to paſs, then it did not come to paſs by <hi>chance.</hi> And if the world, in the firſt matter of it, brought forth it ſelf by <hi>chance,</hi> there could then never have been any thing but chance in it: for chance can produce nothing but chance; there could have been no ſuch thing as a certain cauſe in it. Now we evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee the contrary, that there is no ſuch thing as <hi>chance</hi> is the world. The whole
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95663:43"/>world is a great bundle of cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. When we ſay a thing happens by <hi>chance,</hi> we ſay and mean no more, but that it happened <hi>unexpectedly,</hi> and that we do not at preſent ſee the cauſe of it. That we call <hi>Lottery,</hi> is nothing elſe, but taking the viſible effects of cauſes we purpoſely conceal from our ſelves. He that ſhuffles Cards, does not know what game he ſhall have, becauſe he purpoſely hides the cauſe from himſelf, and takes only the effect. But no man can therefore think there is ſuch a thing as chance in that: for if he looked upon the Cards, as he ſhuffled them, he would find his own diſpoſal of them in ſuch places, was the cauſe of his game. There is a certain fixed regularity in the courſe of every thing, and a genuine dependance of one thing upon another. Nothing moves, nothing operates any way, but as 'tis moved and cauſed: which unanſwerably ſhews, that nothing in the world hath any motion or operation <hi>innately</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi> in it ſelf, but comes all from a firſt mover, and infinite cauſe of every thing. Whatſoever we ſee come to paſs, though at the preſent we cannot point out the cauſe, yet we ſee enough viſible in it, to aſſure us <hi>it has ſome cauſe.</hi> He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a punctual demonſtrative rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95663:43"/>for the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, yet ſees enough in it (by the conſtancy of it, the certain time it keeps, and the due correſpondency it holds to ſome of the heavenly bodies) to ſatisfie him, that there is a natural cauſe of it, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be given for it; and that 'tis not poſſible to be a thing by chance; but is a thing linked into the round of the world, and bears its proportion to the general ſubordination and harmony of things. If the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> be ſo ridiculouſly fooliſh as to ſay, that all that we ſee, and call order and method, is nothing but <hi>chance;</hi> and that every thing happens ſtill by <hi>chance</hi> ſo to be, as we ſee it to be; he muſt either palpably confute himſelf, or elſe deny all the neceſſary cauſes and effects we ſee in the world; and tell us, that what we ſee conſtantly to be, (and never was known nor ſeen otherwiſe to be; and, in the reaſon of the things themſelves muſt needs be ſoe, and cannot be otherwiſe;) is a thing of <hi>meer chance,</hi> and ſo may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be otherwiſe. That is, he muſt ſay, that Rain muſt not neceſſarily moiſten the earth, but may perhaps ſcorch it, and burn it up; and that the Sun muſt not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily heat me, but may perhaps cool me, and chill me; and that Summer is not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95663:44"/>neceſſary to come as it does, but may chance to come in the place of winter, and winter in the place of ſummer.

And therefore thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> heretofore were juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of folly and ignorance, who (when they could not ſolve the doubt [How evil ſhould firſt come into the world, if there was but one God, and that one God infinitely good]) fled to the refuge of this aſſertion [<hi>That there was an eternal good Being, and an eternal ill Being,</hi> that equally from eternity were the Authors of both principles.] Now that this is abſurd, and that things contrary each to other, cannot be eternal, ſeems plain by theſe three Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In direct <hi>Contrariety there muſt be imperfection</hi> and deficiency. For, where two things are both perfect, they cannot be in contrariety, unleſs perfection can oppoſe it ſelf. 'Tis imperfection makes oppoſition. Every thing that is eternal, I have proved before, muſt needs be perfect. And things perfect cannot lie in contrariety one to another, becauſe, in <hi>perfection</hi> there is the height of <hi>harmony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Oppoſition intends deſtruction.</hi> 'Tis the end of contraries; where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95663:45"/>are, each naturally ſtrives to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant by deſtroying the other. Now things eternal can never ceaſe to be, nor to be otherwiſe than they ever were. Therefore ſuch contrariety can never be where there is perfection: becauſe things perfect cannot innately tend to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; for that were the higheſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And here is an utter impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the end. For eternal things can never alter nor deſtroy each other. 'Twere to imagine eternal things eternally tending to deſtroy eternity: than which nothing can be more impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whatever we ſuppoſe ſelf-originated and eternal, muſt needs ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all Being and Perfection in it ſelf; and ſo all other Beings muſt neceſſarily be derived from it; and ſo it can be but one. This viſible experimented truth, <hi>[That all things in the world, though never ſo oppoſite in themſelves, do all regularly and neceſſary iſſue themſelves into one common end: and that the world is a great piece of order and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;]</hi> directly oppoſeth the grand <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who aſcribes the world to meer chance, and will have no other beginning of it, but a <hi>caſual</hi> motion of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>ſmall particles,</hi> which we call <hi>Atoms.</hi> The whole of his principles is to make us
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95663:45"/>believe, that there is an <hi>infinite ultra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundan ſpace, an infinite inanity, where there are an infinite company of Atoms; and theſe Atoms infinitely poſſeſſed with an internal vigour called</hi> gravity, <hi>which occaſioned their eternal motion: and ſo, by their perpetual motion, and various agitation in that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſpace, they came to meet and encounter each other: and by weer chance and hap of ſuch encounters, came into the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſee; and by that meer chance made up this whole world, and moved and danced themſelves into all viſible Beings</hi>—The ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſneſs of which precarious notion, and wholly begged ſuppoſition, I ſhall evidence by theſe conſiderations following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Theſe <hi>Atoms,</hi> in this fancied va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, were either <hi>temporally</hi> there, or <hi>eternally</hi> there. If <hi>temporally,</hi> then they were cauſed, and muſt be placed there by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before them and above them; and then we muſt come to <hi>Divinity.</hi> If eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, then they muſt, of neceſſity, have been without alteration there ſtill, and ſo eternally there. For whatſoever is <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be <hi>unchangeable;</hi> for whatever Being was eternal, can neither ceaſe to be as it was; nor can ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any other thing by varying its own form, and ceaſing it ſelf to be as it ever
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95663:46"/>was. For, ſuppoſe that <hi>Atoms</hi> loſe not their own exiſtence by any Being they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, yet I am ſure, in that variety of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the world is filled with, if they conſiſt of theſe <hi>Atoms,</hi> they are not in the ſame poſture they were in, when they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dancing up and down in that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſpace; ſo that by this notion, here is an infinite of two pieces viſibly, beſides how many more it may conſiſt of, after. For theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> are ſaid to be infinitely moving one while in the infinite ſpace, and another while they are interrupted by meeting one another in that infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then they are turned into bodies, and all parts of the world; and when thoſe compoſitions are diſſolved, who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage what will come of them then? So that things are made to be infinite, and yet changeable, which is impoſſible: for what was infinitely ſo, muſt ever continue to be ſo. Nor can any thing be infinite in change: becauſe, what infinitely was, was the higheſt perfection of being, and ſo can never alter nor change it ſelf. Change is a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to imperfection. Whatever is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite has the higheſt perfection: and to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine then a change in what is infinite, were to imagine a change from the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which is unimaginable and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:95663:46"/>
            <p>Secondly, If the <hi>dancing motion</hi> of theſe <hi>Atoms,</hi> in this fancied ſpace, did by chance firſt dance the world into this <hi>form;</hi> and <hi>caper</hi>'d the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars into their ſtations above us; and placed every thing in the poſture it is in about us, and below us; what is the reaſon theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> never danced themſelves into any thing ſince? If they had an eternal motion in themſelves, they muſt needs move ſtill. Where is there any viſible production by ſuch a concourſe of Atoms? 'Tis a horſe begets a horſe, and one thing begets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: where is any thing made ſo by <hi>Atoms,</hi> as the world is ſaid to be firſt made by them? If <hi>Atoms</hi> ſtill be the parts of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, 'tis plain, they do not compound them in the ſame way they did at firſt. A man that is begotten by another man, and brought forth by a woman, has ſurely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of make, than he had, that was made by a chance-hit of ſome Atoms one againſt another, as they were whirling about in the infinite ſpace. And for that <hi>infinity of worlds</hi> that is produced (as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> will needs have you believe) by the <hi>infinity of Atoms</hi> in the infinite ſpace, 'tis no other than an eminent piece of <hi>Lunacy,</hi> and a Chimaera very well agreeing to the reſt of the <hi>Atomical</hi> doctrine. For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95663:47"/>not bring the leaſt reaſon to prove it, unleſs you let him firſt beg the queſtion, and grant him an <hi>infinity of Atoms,</hi> that ſo he may argue from an infinity of matter, to an infinity of worlds.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The caſual conjunction of theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> could not, by that chance, make the world, becauſe 'tis made with a principle of reaſon: and they could not have induced ſuch a principle by any chance, unleſs ſome way or other they had had it inherent in themſelves before; for nothing can transferre that to another, which it hath not it ſelf. And if they had been poſſeſt with that principle of reaſon, if <hi>Epicurus</hi> his <hi>Atoms</hi> had been rational Atoms, (and truly he might as well have begged and ſuppoſed them into reaſon as motion: for bare matter can no more be proved to have an intrinſique motion in it, which would make it abſolutely neceſſary for all matter to move at all times, than it can be proved to think, <hi>will</hi> and reaſon; and he that beggs and takes things for granted without the trouble of proof, ſhould take all that would ſerve his turn.) I ſay, had <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atoms been reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Atoms, they would never have done any thing by chance, becauſe they had a <hi>ſuperiour principle</hi> to do it by; they would
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95663:47"/>never have put that to the <hi>venture,</hi> which might have been made <hi>certain.</hi> Their own principle would have inſtructed them not to have put that to the venture of chance, whether it ſhould be, or ſhould not be, which, by reaſon, might have been made certain to be. A man that hath eyes would never ſhut them, and go to diſcover co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours by feeling. Every ſuperiour prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple muſt needs act above an inferiour. Whatever did happen, by meer chance, to be, had a power to be, and by reaſon might have been made certain to be. How monſtrouſly unreaſonable is it to believe, that theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> (that had nothing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but bare matter and motion, upon the beſt ſuppoſition) ſhould produce in man, and in nothing elſe, a <hi>rational ſoul!</hi> and that that in man, which we call the rational ſoul, ſhould be nothing elſe but the more active and generous part of theſe Atoms! which became ſo, by being more ſmooth and round than the reſt! which you muſt believe fell, by chance, all to the ſhare of men: and no other Being had the hap to have any of them in their compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. We muſt alſo believe theſe <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Atoms</hi> to be ſome of one ſize, and ſome of another; ſome of one quality, and ſome of another, and yet all eternal: which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95663:48"/>is a flat contradiction to all notion of eternity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Suppoſe (in theſe <hi>Atoms</hi>) matter and motion, the world could never come to be made fortuitouſly thereby. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> all motion, in every thing, muſt either be from a ſuperiour mover, or from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ſelf-originated principle of motion in it ſelf. If from a ſuperiour mover, then we come to God. If from an innate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that any thing hath in and from it ſelf, that motion muſt needs be eternal: For nothing can move, that is not ſet on work, or that doth not infinitely ſet it ſelf on work. If motion have beginning, it muſt own it ſelf to ſome beginner: if it have no beginning, it muſt be infinite and eternal: and there needs no better or other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that any motion had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, than when we ſee it has an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for as all mechanick motion, by its coming to an end, ſhews plainly it had a <hi>primum movens,</hi> and was ſet on work; ſo does all other motion, by its perioding and ending, declare plainly, it had its beginning <hi>ab extra,</hi> and is not ſelf-originated and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: So that if the <hi>motion of theſe Atoms</hi> came from a firſt mover, then they came from a cauſe; and their motion muſt needs be regular and correſponding to that firſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95663:48"/>cauſe. If they had no firſt mover, then their motion muſt be eternal, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſayes it is; and nothing, that moves eternally, can move by chance; becauſe it muſt needs have the higheſt perfection of motion: And where that is, 'tis impoſſible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch thing as chance. For whatever did eternally move, can never ceaſe ſo to move; and ſo can have no ſuch thing as chance converſant about it. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Matter it ſelf cannot be moved <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitouſly,</hi> by motion ſuppoſed inherent in it: that is utterly impoſſible; becauſe all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter determines its own motion. Heavy things move downward, and cannot fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly move upward. Had there been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but chance to ſement the world, the <hi>heavy</hi> part would have been ſure to have gone <hi>downward,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> part <hi>upward;</hi> and they would never have met, nor pieced together. The motion of things is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the nature of their being. And therefore we cannot reaſonably ſay, that bare matter and motion ever cauſed any thing by chance; unleſs you will ſay, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every thing to be by chance, juſt as it <hi>muſt needs</hi> be, and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> be, which is a contradiction. Who can believe <hi>chance</hi> the cauſe, and <hi>certainty</hi> the <hi>effect?</hi> We ſee all things moving in perfect order; and not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95663:49"/>only our experience aſſures us of this, but our reaſon ſhews us, it muſt neceſſarily ſo come to paſs. For ſuch cauſes do produce ſuch effects ſuitable to the nature and being of things, and an intrinſique cauſality and innate dependence upon each other: which muſt needs be the effect of the ſupreme and great cauſe of all. Let any man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that noble principle in man, the <hi>rational ſoul,</hi> with the ſuitableneſs of it to govern himſelf, and the reſt of the world; and how all things, in their being and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency lie proportioned to ſuch a ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Let him view the make of a man and a woman, and ſee how ſuitable, and how neceſſary they are one to another in their very compoſition; and how the <hi>male</hi> and the <hi>female,</hi> in all other creatures, are adapted to propagate their own kind, and to be uſeful each to other; and the inſtinct they carry about them ſo to be. Let him look upon the faces of men and women, and conſider them; there never having been yet ſeen any two without ſome variety. Let him look above him, and below him, and round about him, and ſee what <hi>harmony</hi> there is between the Heavens and the Earth: how the well-being of the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the influence of the other; and how certain and regular thoſe are, by which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95663:49"/>all times and ſeaſons are exactly determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let him look upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> and conſider how uſeful that is to the world, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a trade and commerce among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to make each one capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the good of all the reſt. Let him view the conſtant courſe of its ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the ſtanding Law of its <hi>Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> whereby ſuch a <hi>maſs of waters</hi> are ſtill kept in one channel, and continued in their proper ſtation. And when he has viewed theſe, and a thouſand things more, that lye obvious to his reaſonable contemplation; if he then think the compoſition of the whole univerſe, and all the parts of it, and the grand <hi>oeconomy</hi> that is in it, came from <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but meer chance,</hi> he renders himſelf a perſon fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than <hi>diſputation.</hi> Yet ſuch wretched ſhifts are men forced to fly to, when they are labouring to exclude the notion of God, and baniſh a Deity out of the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Epicurean Atomiſt</hi> falls plainly under the heavy ſtroaks of ſeveral groſs abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He makes his <hi>Atoms</hi> (which are the matter of which he will have the world to conſiſt) to move about in his <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-mundan-ſpace,</hi> without a tendency to a center. Which is perfectly impoſſible, that any matter ſhould move, by a motion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95663:50"/>innate in it, without tendency to ſome cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or other. He affirms, [his Atoms could never diſcontinue their motion, but when they encountred other Atoms, and were, by that impulſe, deflected into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe.] To believe this, were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the plaineſt experimental truths in Philoſophy; and to ſuppoſe matter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without either a <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> or a <hi>terminus ad quem. Secondly,</hi> He aſcribes that to dull matter, and ſenſleſs motion, which we aſcribe to God infinitely perfect. For he ſuppoſes his <hi>Atoms infinite,</hi> and in an <hi>infinite ſpace:</hi> And ſo he makes things mutable, and things imperfect, infinite. For if theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> had not been ſo, they muſt needs have continued without varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or change, as once they were, and (as he ſaies) eternally they were. Whatever he objects againſt us about the infinity of God, with ten times more force he objects the ſame againſt himſelf, for the infinity of his own Atoms and ſuppoſed <hi>inanity. Thirdly,</hi> He makes more to ariſe out of his matter and motion, than is contained in the matter and motion themſelves; which is the rational ſoul of man. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He makes <hi>(firſt)</hi> eternal cauſes to have chanceable effects; and then thoſe chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects to be the cauſe of all certainty
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95663:50"/>and regularity. He makes eternal cauſes to have chanceable effects; for he ſaies himſelf, <hi>[His Atoms, and his ultra-mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan ſpace are eternal: and the motion of theſe Atoms eternal likewiſe in it:]</hi> And the effect of theſe eternal cauſes is, that by chance, they make this world, and this chance, in making the world, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all the certainty, conſtancy, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, beauty and regularity of it. There cannot be two things more ridiculouſly ſaid, than firſt, to make chance the effect of an eternal cauſe, and ſo the moſt certain cauſe; and ſecondly, to make chance the cauſe of all order and certainty. 'Tis as true to ſay, the Sun is the cauſe of all darkneſs; and wiſdom the true Mother of all folly. Laſtly, He makes things to cauſe themſelves; which is the ſupremeſt of all <hi>Non-ſenſe.</hi> For (ſaies he) <hi>theſe moving particles, this matter and motion, make up the univerſe:</hi> And ſo, if there be nothing above them, they muſt needs make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the univerſe. If this matter and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made and moved, 'tis not eternal; if you ſuppoſe it is eternal, then that which is eternal varies it ſelf into all forms and compoſitions; and ſo is not unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which all eternal things are. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that which is infinite may beget
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95663:51"/>variety of other things diſtinct from its own being, as God himſelf doth; yet that which is infinite cannot do ſo, by varying it ſelf, which theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> do, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come changeable; which cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to what is infinite. When theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> turn themſelves, by their motion, into bodies, and all other parts of the world, (ſuppoſing all the principles of the <hi>Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Philoſophy,</hi> that they deſtroy not themſelves;) they alter the form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their exiſtence; and ſo, I am ſure, are not as they eternally were. Nor could they indeed be eternal; becauſe, had they been eternal in the poſture they were, they would have had perfection in that poſture, and ſo could never have changed from what was infinitely perfect. In ſhort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either the world was eternal, in ſome <hi>pre-exiſting matter</hi> to what we ſee, (either <hi>Atoms,</hi> or what you will:) or it was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal juſt in the courſe we now ſee it. If it were eternal in any <hi>pre-exiſting matter,</hi> that matter muſt needs ceaſe to be ſo, by varying it ſelf into this world: unleſs you will make things changeable and imperfect infinite, which is impoſſible. Whatever eternally was, muſt eternally remain as it was, or elſe 'tis not eternal. 'Tis mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly abſurd to talk of a changeable
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95663:51"/>eternity. If you take the other way, (to make the world eternal juſt as we ſee it,) you muſt unavoidably make corruption, generation, and all parts of the round and courſe of the world, eternal too; unleſs you admit <hi>priority</hi> and <hi>poſteriority,</hi> which are plainly enough deſtructive to all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternity. If any thing had been unchangeable and unalterable, and cauſed other things diſtinct from it ſelf, (as we ſay Gods does,) it had altered the caſe: but to ſay the world is eternal, when every part that makes the whole of its ſelf, and all the matter of the world is perpetually altering and varying, 'tis utterly impoſſible, without making the courſe of it in changes, in generating, and corrupting particular forms, eternal too. Though God created variety of creatures, that, ſeveral waies, alter and change; yet he (in his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) is unchangeable, and ſtill the ſame he ever was. If he had dilated his own being, and ſpread it into the variety of the world, and made the world out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſubſiſted only in it, it had been impoſſible he ſhould have been eternal: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then, he would not now have been what he ever before had been.</p>
            <p>A third Argument to prove that God
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95663:52"/>is, and that he made the world, is, <hi>that witneſs, that he hath left to himſelf and his own Being, in the CONSCIENCES of men.</hi> This is ſo ſafe, and ſo ſure a way to bring us to God, that, unleſs, we had ſeen him face to face, there could not have been any thing, that could poſſibly have given us a clearer evidence of the being of God, and of the relation our own beings have to him, than this hath done. The underſtanding faculty of man is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt part of the world; and in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty God hath eſtabliſhed the knowledge of himſelf. Conſcience, in a man, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the true reſult of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about himſelf, in reference to a ſupreme Being above him. Which (if there were no God) were to no purpoſe: and the nobleſt exerciſe of man in his rational part would be wholly in vain; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would not endure to have thought, of the meaneſt and loweſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of nature. He rightly denied, that <hi>nature did the leaſt thing in vain.</hi> That we call <hi>conſcience,</hi> is not only ſeated in the underſtanding of man, but has a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity in the exerciſe of that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, purely relating to its ſelf. For <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not only an ability in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, (as 'tis relating to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95663:52"/>when a man will make uſe of it to determine his <hi>actions</hi> and his condition, in reference to God, and a ſuperiour Being: But conſcience carries, in its deſcription, an innate inſtinct, and neceſſary inclination in the underſtanding to operate this way; and to paſs a continual judgement upon a mans ſelf, in all a man does, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, and that primary and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme concern of pleaſing him, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to his will. Can we ſuppoſe this great wheel of the underſtanding ſhould move this way, without a firſt mover? And move about <hi>nothing?</hi> Move in vain? Whence ſhould this principle in man come? We find it written in fair cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters all the world over. Man ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world, but what is inferiour to him, and under his juriſdiction. If God had not been <hi>above,</hi> there could never have been any ſuch thing as fear and conſcience <hi>below.</hi> There could never have been an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal fear of an <hi>inviſible nothing</hi> in all ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creatures. God and conſcience are perfect relatives. How is it poſſible to believe a diſtinction of good and evil, and a conſcience about them (in order to reward and puniſhment from a ſupreme power) ſhould be naturally inherent in every man, as we find it is; unleſs ſome
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95663:53"/>
               <hi>ſuperiour Power</hi> had made us, and fixed ſuch principles in us, by our firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? How comes it to paſs, that good is preferred before evil, when there is more viſible in the world of the one than of the other, and mens inclinations lie more to evil than to good? But that God (in our very make) hath determined thoſe things, and left an indelible teſtimony in our own ſouls about them. No man can (if he would) think evil to be better than good, and put one in the place of the other; which ſhews plainly, that the ſoul of man relates to a ſupreme Being that made him, and is above him. Can we believe, that all the exerciſe of mens <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> in the hopes and fears we find fixed in them, about a condition after this life, to be meer <hi>deluſions?</hi> which they be, if there be no God. The Atheiſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with all his ſkill, cannot diſband his own fears, nor run away from his own conſcience, no more than he can run away from himſelf: he finds ſeaſons, wherein he ſmarts under the laſhes of it. Conſcience is ſuch a thing, as is not (in the principle of it) <hi>dicourſed into men,</hi> but born with them. Nor can you ever diſcouſre men out of it; nor can a man, at his pleaſure, argue it from himſelf. The ſoul of man
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95663:53"/>is conſtituted with a diſtinction of good and evil, in reference to a ſuperiour being, that has a ſupremacy over it. Every mans own breaſt is the proof of this: A mans own ſoul ſubſcribes to it. Men are full of exerciſes of conſcience about things not puniſhable in this world, nor any way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable here. A man may as well deny that love and hatred are inherent in men, as that conſcience is inherent in them, and a reference to ſomewhat above them. A man, by counterwork, may ſooner get a conqueſt over any part of himſelf, than over that we call <hi>Conſcience:</hi> becauſe in every ſtep he takes that way, whether he will or no, he is his own executioner. Whither will the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> flee from himſelf to find ſhelter againſt the force of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable argument?</p>
            <p>Two things he uſually recurrs to, (and 'tis much the ſame defence he made againſt that univerſal acknowledgement there hath been of a Deity in the world.) Firſt, ſayes the Atheiſt <hi>[This you call conſcience in men, is nothing but fear habituated in them by tales that were, at the firſt, told them, and ſo transferred from one to another, about inviſible things.]</hi> And ſecondly, <hi>[That it is not true, in fact, that all men are troubled with this we call conſcience; for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95663:54"/>many have no ſuch thing, nor find any work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it at all, in themſelves.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt, I anſwer. Conſcience in men could never be begotten in them by any <hi>humane contrivance:</hi> becauſe 'tis a thing can never be confined within any humane bounds. Other men are ſo far from having the power over a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that a man cannot govern it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Conſcience gives its evidence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we like it or nor. The work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is often to oppoſe a man himſelf in the <hi>violent emanations</hi> of his own will. If it had been, at the firſt, created by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented fictions and fables, thoſe would have contained the <hi>boundaries</hi> of it: and by the ſame way men were at the firſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with it, they might more reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be capable, at any time, of being delivered from it; becauſe (upon the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> grounds) if there be no God, it was begotten by a lye; and 'tis ſurely poſſible to be nulled by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the lye, and revealing the truth. And yet we find, let men ſay as long as they will, <hi>there is no God,</hi> conſcience will ſtill abide.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If conſcience had its firſt riſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95663:54"/>from mens being poſſeſſed with notions of feigned and pretended Deities, and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entities</hi> of that kind; how can it (with any good reaſon) be conceived, that any man ſhould ever arrive at ſuch an exerciſe of conſcience, as to oppoſe all the men in the world, and his own inclinations beſides, upon the <hi>ſingle account of conſcience?</hi> And yet this often falls out to be the caſe: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in a man, carries it againſt himſelf, and all others oppoſing it. Now if there be no real God, to make impreſſion upon his conſcience; nor to which (by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct) his conſcience can refer; and all men agree to tell him things contrary to what he calls his conſcience; and his own inclinations ſtrongly oppoſe too; whence ſhould ſuch a conſcience and ſuch a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple come? The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt of neceſſity make a ſally out of this world to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is really and truly above it, and beyond it, and that made it, or elſe the ground of ſuch a circumſtanced conſcience can never be found out.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſcience in men could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo baſely deſcended, nor come from ſo <hi>mean an original,</hi> as the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> pretends; and yet have ſo noble and real effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mankind, and ſo much to their general
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95663:55"/>and particular good and advantage, as it really has. It layes an arreſt upon men, and reſtrains them from open and ſecret evil and injuſtice: and provokes them to do (and gives them ſatisfaction in doing,) whatever is juſt and righteous. Nothing is more certain and real than the effects of conſcience, both in the trouble it gives men, and alſo in the ſatisfaction it affords them. 'Tis impoſſible ſuch general and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al effects ſhould ariſe from a <hi>very lie,</hi> a meer nothing. He that will ſuppoſe that, debaſeth mankind ſo far, that there can be no certainty in the word of any thing men have, or of any thing they are. For though ſome particular perſons may be, by ſome accidental means, ſingly poſſeſt with fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and vain conceits; yet 'tis ridiculous to conceive, that <hi>mankind</hi> ſhould <hi>all</hi> be poſſeſt with <hi>one fancy</hi> without the leaſt ground for it; and that fancy ſhould uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally operate in the ſame way. He that aims to make all the world uncertain in what they generally agree in, I wonder where he intends to lay a foundation of any certainty amongſt mankind! What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wants a natural innate evidence to reaſon, can never be ſuppoſed to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the univerſal reaſon of the world: unleſs you will ſuppoſe reaſon not to be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95663:55"/>reaſon, and make it a meer <hi>nullity.</hi> Men every where find the workings of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo real, that they produce troubles the whole world cannot remove: and ſuch peace and ſatisfaction in men, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole world, nor themſelves by any other workings of their own ſouls, could lead themſelves into. Which muſt needs inſure us, that there is an intercourſe between God, and that we call conſcience; and that it has a peculiar derivation from, and relation to him: and is not begotten by a ſlaviſh ſubjected credulity to vain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>fantaſms,</hi> and <hi>empty nothings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had there not been truth in the notion of God, (and ſo real a ground for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;) and had not the principle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience been naturally inherent in mankind; men would never have been capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived in a ſafe object of worſhip. The truth is, <hi>Religion</hi> (let it be never ſo heterodox and erroneous) confirms the principle of Religion it ſelf, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that is in men toward God and the true Religion. For take <hi>Mahumetaniſm,</hi> or what falſe Religion you will, the ground of mens ſubjection to it was an in-bred devotion that is to God above them; their ignorance of whom, made them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to pay that devotion, where they were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95663:56"/>deluded and miſtaken. I doubt not, but that every perſon, that has performed any worſhip ſince the world began, though never ſo falſe, had an implicite tendency (through that innate principle that was in him) <hi>to the true God.</hi> We will ſuppoſe the moſt the Atheiſt can deſire us to ſuppoſe for his advantage in this caſe; that men under a falſe worſhip may have the ſame exerciſe of conſcience, (in trouble, and ſatisfaction) that others have in that we call the true and right knowledge of God. Suppoſe a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in matter of conſcience as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and the Atheiſt thence inferring that conſcience univerſally may be a <hi>cheat</hi> upon men every where, becauſe it is ſo there, in that particular caſe: Yet this will no way help him; for, in this caſe; the principle of conſcience it ſelf is no cheat put upon them: the <hi>cheat</hi> lies in the wrong exerciſe and application of conſcience, of which we are not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of conſcience it ſelf. This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth conſcience in them. 'Tis not here, whether conſcience or no conſcience; a God, or no God: But whether a true God, or a falſe God; the being of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power is admitted: the deceit lies in the application. 'Tis not all one to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95663:56"/>ſay, <hi>[Becauſe I am deceived in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of conſcience, therefore I may be as well deceived in the principle of conſcience it ſelf.]</hi> And <hi>[that 'tis as eaſie to make conſcience in men by deceit, as to miſlead it when 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting.]</hi> Becauſe, in the one caſe, when men are deceived and deluded in their underſtandings, and ſo in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, about the object and manner of worſhip, there is a viſible ground for ſuch a deceit, and a rational account to be given of it: Becauſe there is a real God exiſting, and a certain principle of conſcience in men towards him, upon which (through their weakneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) a cheat may operate. But in the other caſe, to <hi>beget ſuch a principle as conſcience</hi> it ſelf, by a cheat, in men, and then apply it as we pleaſe, is moſt abſurd to imagine: becauſe here is no ground at all for ſuch a cheat to be built upon. For if there be no God, as the Atheiſt ſayes, there is not, I am ſure there is no real ground then for impoſing the <hi>cheat of conſcience</hi> upon the world. In the one caſe I perſwade a man to worſhip a falſe God, where there is really a true God, and his conſcience tells him, he muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſome God: and in the other caſe, I perſwade him to believe he muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95663:57"/>ſome God, when he had no ſenſe of any God, and that there is really no God. The truth is, all the <hi>falſe Copies of a Deity</hi> in the world, declare plainly, there is ſome <hi>true original.</hi> Men would never have gone about to counterfeit ſilver, if there had been no ſuch metal. Men have been ſtill ſo prone to worſhip <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> that they have layen the more open and liable to miſtakes and cheats in the <hi>objects</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of worſhip. The trouble and ſatisfaction men have in their conſcience when 'tis erroneous, highly confirms, and no way deſtroyes this principle of conſcience it ſelf. The greater the cheat is upon men in the <hi>manner</hi> of worſhip, the more evident is the principle of worſhip within them. He that is deceived in the <hi>object</hi> of his love, in loving trifles and bables, and things not worth love, gives the ſtronger evidence of ſuch a principle as love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him. All falſe worſhip is granted upon that innate ſubjection men are born withall to the true God. If there had been no true God, <hi>Mahomet</hi> would never have been worſhipped; nor would there ever have been any Idols or falſe Gods. Though men fall into the thickeſt darkneſs about the <hi>objects</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of worſhip,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95663:57"/>yet the principle of conſcience and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtill remains, and is thereby juſtified and aſſerted.</p>
            <p>For the Atheiſts ſecond Objection, which is againſt the univerſality of this principle in men, that we call conſcience, <hi>[That 'tis not general: and that many find no ſuch thing in themſelves.]</hi> The anſwer is, 'tis not neceſſary upon his own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition granted, that every <hi>univerſal</hi> ſhould be made up of each <hi>individual</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: that I have proved before. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man has debauched himſelf into ſo great a ſottiſhneſs, that he has no uſe of reaſon; ſuppoſe a man has lived ſo long that <hi>he dotes,</hi> and is childiſh; will you ſay, therefore reaſon is not an univerſal principle? If the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> ſay, theſe things happen upon particular accidents; ſo ſay I, does the other, if any ſuch thing ever fall out to be. Where will you find a man (without a particular and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary remark upon him) without ſome conſcience? But ſuppoſe a man, by Gods particular permiſſion, have for a time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the exerciſe of that principle, and has taken much pains to <hi>ſear it up:</hi> does that argue that there never was in him any ſuch principle as conſcience? or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95663:58"/>does it not rather eſtabliſh the truth of it? The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will often tell you, that what men call conſcience, is nothing but <hi>melancholy</hi> and moroſe thoughts of men, when they are in ill humour. But 'tis to be ſtrongly preſumed he finds ſome image of it in himſelf, that makes him able ſo to <hi>nick-name</hi> it in others. Let any, the higheſt Atheiſt, tell me, whether ever he got, for any time, rid of his conſcience, without being at ſome trouble to oppoſe it? And let him dreſs it up as he will, and give it what name he will, and oppoſe it under what notion he will; yet 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he landed in this world with ſuch a principle; and let me tell him, he can never murder it ſo ſure, but that, for ought he knows, it may revive upon him again. Let any man intoxicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and be never ſo drunk, yet his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will probably have a reſurrection. He cannot be ſure to immerge that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, unleſs he drown his own Being. When he awakes, he will find he is a man, though he did what he could to make himſelf a beaſt. Thoſe Monſters of men amongſt the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> who triumphed moſt in pretending <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> (threatned the wind if it blew upon them, and the clouds if they rained upon them,)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95663:58"/>betrayed, upon every ſmall occaſion, the dreadfulleſt fears imaginable. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, at laſt, cryed out, <hi>The Galilaean had overcome him.</hi> The great <hi>Hector</hi> of the Gods, <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, was the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent coward that ever lived, in thoſe things he moſt defied: nothing ever fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any man more than thoſe two things did him, <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Gods;</hi> ſo you ſhall find it reported in <hi>Cicero.</hi> His <hi>Atoms</hi> had not <hi>ſolved his conſcience,</hi> nor cured him, it ſeems, of his fears; he was <hi>certain</hi> of them, though he bottom'd all the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>chance.</hi> How many are to be ſeen dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that when they think they have ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interred their conſcience, when they come to any extremity, ſoon find a revival of it again?</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo univerſally certain amongſt mankind, but what is ſubject to variation in <hi>individuals:</hi> which ſtrongly proves, that the world has not immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity nor eternity affixed to it. Sometimes we ſee ſuch members of the body, and ſuch faculties of the ſoul ceaſe to exert themſelves in particulars: but yet ſuch monſters (for they are no better) ought not to deſtroy the general character and definition we give of natural Beings. In this matter of conſcience (which does
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95663:59"/>plainly admit the Being of a God, to which it hath immediate relation,) two things ſtrongly plead for the generality of it in all men, above the generality of any one thing that belongs to them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That 'tis the great <hi>Truſtee</hi> for God in the world. And (unleſs it be in ſome very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe, where God concurrs with a man to extinguiſh it, as a ſpecial and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgement upon him) it ſeems plain, that no man can totally obliterate it in himſelf. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis the great <hi>medium</hi> he will judge the world by. He will deal with men according to their light; and the conſciences of men ſhall perform that great office of <hi>accuſing</hi> or <hi>excuſing,</hi> in the great day. He that either actually has a principle of conſcience, or ever had ſuch a thing, or comes hereafter to find that ſuch a principle is within him, gives a witneſs ſufficient to the <hi>Being</hi> of ſuch a principle; and I believe the Atheiſt will undertake a hard taſk, to find <hi>one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual man,</hi> well in his wits, that is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that compaſs. He that tells me, he hath no conſcience, and expects I ſhould believe him; may as well expect that I ſhould take his word, if he ſhould tell me, he is not of the ſame compoſition with other men: and does not ſee nor hear,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95663:59"/>though he has eyes and ears viſibly, as other men have.</p>
            <p>A fourth Argument to prove the truth of a ſupreme Being above the world, is, <hi>the miracles that have been wrought in the world.</hi> This ſtabs the Atheiſt, and mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounds him. If ever in fact, there were ſuch a thing as a <hi>miracle,</hi> the Atheiſt is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably gone. All his <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> fall to the ground; all the fig-leaves he can get will never hide him from apparent naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly. To give this argument its due force, I ſhall endeavour two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To prove that a <hi>miracle leads us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to God;</hi> and is, in its being, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to all an Atheiſt ſayes. And ſecondly, That the <hi>fact of ſuch miracles</hi> is true: and that we have good reaſon to believe it is ſo; and that there have been often ſuch in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A miracle</hi> is properly, <hi>that which could not come to paſs by any natural, cauſe.</hi> If a man <hi>actually dead</hi> ſhould be raiſed again, it were a thing could not be brought to paſs in any natural way: nor could any natural account be given of it. If a man <hi>born blind,</hi> and that had no eyes, ſhould, by a word ſpeaking, be made to ſee,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95663:60"/>'twere a thing out of all humane reach to do. You muſt ſtep out of the world, and take a view of ſomething above it, to know how ſuch a thing could come to paſs. The working of a miracle is the doing of that, which (apparently to our ſenſes, and our reaſon) nothing viſible in the world could do. And if ſo, it muſt needs be done by ſomewhat that is ſuperiour to the world. Nay, 'tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the doing of that, which is quite contrary to the natural motion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tendency of the whole univerſe. If a man be <hi>once dead,</hi> and that principle of life and motion that was in him be gone, 'tis natural for his body to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and vary the form of its matter. Now to make ſuch a man live again (who by the ſtanding Law of Nature, died; and muſt, by the ſame Law, corrupt) is not only a thing above all natural power, but a thing <hi>directly contrary</hi> to nature, and perfectly inverts the whole courſe of it. For 'tis as much the reaſon and courſe of nature, for a man to die, as 'tis, at the firſt, for him to live. If therefore any ſuch thing were ever done in the world, it muſt neceſſarily be brought to paſs by a <hi>Power above all natural cauſes,</hi> and the utmoſt ability of all natural Beings.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95663:60"/>We muſt needs erect a Throne for a power ſuperiour to nature, and ſuch a power as muſt directly lead us to God. 'Tis as much a miracle, and as far above all natural power, to revive a man actually dead, as to make a man out of a ſtone, or form him from a lump of earth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the world, in which of the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> notions of it you will; if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>above</hi> it, nor <hi>beſides</hi> it, then 'tis plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible that any thing ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen or come to paſs, but what has its riſe and foundation from ſomewhat <hi>within</hi> it. For if there be nothing exiſting but this world, there can be nothing produced but what this world can produce. But, that we call a <hi>miracle</hi> is ſuch a thing, as is quite beyond the worlds production: neither the reaſonable part, nor the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part, nor the whole together, can produce a miracle. Not the <hi>reaſonable part:</hi> for the great and genuine buſineſs of reaſon, is, to place things in their due dependencies each upon other; and to know cauſes producing effects; and means ſuited to ends. Reaſon can never elevate any thing, in its operation, beyond it ſelf, nor force an act from it, beyond the compaſs of its own Being. That reaſon has an innate antipathy to: 'twere to ſet
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95663:61"/>reaſon againſt it ſelf, and ſay, reaſon ſhall produce things without reaſon, and againſt reaſon. Reaſon cannot the imagined to deal in that, for which no reaſon can be given. And therefore, when we ſee a <hi>miracle,</hi> (a thing that can have no natural cauſe) or reaſon directs us to look to ſomewhat above the world, that muſt needs be the cauſe of it. <hi>Not the ſenſible part</hi> of the world: for that can never alter its courſe. Nature is a perfect Law to it ſelf, which it can never repeal. This we are aſſured of, not only by our experience of the conſtant courſe that is kept by all natural Beings: but becauſe they keep ſuch a courſe, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries an intrinſick reaſon for it in their very nature and being; and ſuch a courſe as they muſt keep, and can keep no other. If you dig up a Tree, and cut off the root, 'twill certainly die. This we are aſſured of, not only from the fact of it, that we continually find it ſo, but our reaſon neceſſarily tells us, it muſt be ſo, and can be no otherwiſe. And therefore whatever is done above all natural power, and contrary to all natural operation, muſt needs ſilence our ſenſe and our reaſon, and all parts of the world; and forceth us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to ſomewhat above the world, that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95663:61"/>muſt be Lord over it, and the great diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of it. Two things ſeem to make it plain, that the whole world, and all the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that nature has, can never produce a <hi>miracle. Firſt,</hi> Nature can never go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it ſelf, nor do any thing by a power above it ſelf. The bounds of every thing is its own being. 'Tis an abſurdity to ſay, a thing ſhould <hi>out-do it ſelf:</hi> or that the effect ſhould be greater than the cauſe. If any thing be done that is beyond all the power of nature, that could never be cauſed by nature. To cure a man that is ſick of a diſeaſe; or to raiſe a man that is a natural creeple to a perfect ſoundneſs, by ſpeaking a word to him, is beyond all the confines of natural power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be an effect ariſing from any natural cauſe: there being no ſuch thing, potentially, in nature it ſelf, nor any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative operation natural in ſuch a way. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nature cannot contradict it ſelf: becauſe, its productions are ſuitable to, and inherent in its own being. Nature is as a free agent, ſo a neceſſary agent. The fire cannot be cold, nor the water hot. Throw men into the fire, and if they be not burnt, they muſt be beholding to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above nature; for nature will deſtroy them. If a man ſhould walk in the air
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95663:62"/>and not fall, and walk upon the waters and not ſink, it muſt be by a help ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. For nature ſhould, otherwiſe, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelf; which it cannot do. And to ſay, its effects ſhould ceaſe, is all one, as to ſay nature it ſelf, in its own being, ſhould ceaſe, and ſo the world ſhould ceaſe. Whatſoever can go beyond the power of nature, and contradict the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt needs be above the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and what is ſo, muſt needs be above the power of the world. And this doth, two waies, evidently overthrow the vain ſuppoſition of the worlds eternity. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> If there be any power <hi>above it,</hi> it cannot be eternal: unleſs you will make two eternals, one above another; which is abſurd, and perfectly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> If ever the courſe of nature and this world were ſtopped and croſſed, then I am ſure, the world, in the courſe of it, cannot have been eternal neither.</p>
            <p>Two things are uſually objected againſt <hi>miracles.</hi> Firſt, <hi>The matter of fact is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</hi> And Secondly, <hi>The Atheiſt</hi> will tell you, <hi>that thoſe things we call miracles, were not really and truly ſo: but were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and unuſual things, brought about by ſome ſecret natural cauſe, though not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95663:62"/>known nor perceived.</hi> For the firſt of theſe Objections, I will handle it diſtinctly by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, I anſwer. Every thing in the world was, at the firſt, a <hi>miracle:</hi> nor could any reaſon be given of it. Which is a plain proof that God made the world; and that it did not make it ſelf. There was no other cauſe of all originals in nature, and of the firſt things, that were in the world, but that God pleaſed to make them. No doubt, at the firſt, a man might have called the Sun, or a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, a great miracle. Nor could they ever find out any natural cauſe of them, nor of the firſt being of any thing. The whole world was a ſtupendious miracle, and without any reaſon to be given for it, but what lay in the makers breaſt. To me therefore that ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems wiſe and excellent <hi>[That it is abſurd for any man to go about to define firſt principles: becauſe they cannot be defined.]</hi> But ſince the world is extant, and our conſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it, and converſe with it, makes it no more a miracle to us, than we are to our ſelves: and ſince we find that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fixation in the worlds firſt make, that there is no more ſince made, but a continuance of the world in a natural or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95663:63"/>courſe, and ſucceſſion; and that theſe firſt originals do, by a certain neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary law of their own being and exiſtence, propagate the world, in a way not only obvious to our ſenſes, but demonſtratively to our reaſon; and that ſuch beings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe to operate as they do, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not operate otherwiſe than they do; we come rightly to call that a <hi>miracle,</hi> which is neither one of the worlds original pieces, or firſt principles, nor any thing that can naturally be deduced from any or all of them, in the regular way of the worlds exiſting. In anſwering therefore this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I will firſt admit all that can be admitted to the Atheiſt's advantage; which is, that whenſoever we ſee any thing come to paſs, that we are not able to give an account how, in a natural, and in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of the world, it ſhould come to paſs: and though we have not ſeen it come to paſs before; yet, in that caſe, if there be a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of a remote and occult cauſe, that we do not, at the preſent, ſee nor comprehend, there is no abſolute neceſſity to impoſe that as a <hi>miracle</hi> upon any man; becauſe he will ſay, 'tis more reaſonable to believe it to come from ſomewhat he doth ſee, (if there be a poſſibility of it,) than to come from what he doth not ſee. But,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95663:63"/>when the caſe falls out to be, that a thing is brought to paſs, to which we are not only unable to aſſign a natural cauſe, but ſuch a thing as is not poſſible to have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe; (which is neceſſarily to be concluded, when it either overthrows the courſe of nature, and goes directly counter to it, or is evidently above it, and ſuperiour to it) in ſuch a caſe mankind muſt ſubmit to it as a <hi>miracle,</hi> and go to ſomewhat ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to nature, to find the cauſe of it. There can never be a natural cauſe aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>raiſing a dead man to life;</hi> 'tis both above nature, and againſt nature. For any man to be able, in one moment, to ſpeak all languages, is a thing above nature, and naturally impoſſible: for we ſee and know, that men muſt arrive at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any language, by induſtry and uſe, and cannot attain it otherwiſe. In ſuch caſes, as we ſee no viſible natural cauſe for ſuch things, ſo 'tis utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible there ſhould be any. If a man ſhould vaniſh out of our ſight, and in two or three minutes convey himſelf a hundred miles off; as we could give no reaſon for it, ſo our reaſon aſſures us it were impoſſible any natural reaſon ever ſhould be given for it. There is no room for any poſſibility of an <hi>occult cauſe;</hi> 'tis, we know, out of all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95663:64"/>natural compaſs, and ſuch a thing as all the power of the world can never perform; and muſt of neceſſity be brought to paſs by a power ſuperiour to it.</p>
            <p>For the other Objection the Atheiſt may make, which is, <hi>To deny that ever there were any ſuch miracles wrought in the world:</hi> and that the matter of fact about them is not true. Firſt, I muſt tell the Atheiſt, if he will believe nothing but what he ſees, nor give credit to any thing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by former ages, and delivered down to us, he muſt confine himſelf to a very narrow part of the world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, fall below that due ſtation a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creature ought to keep. When ever my reaſon can aſſure me of a thing, by arriving at a ſatisfaction about it, ſuch as reaſon requires, I ought to be aſcertained of it; becauſe <hi>doubting,</hi> in its <hi>foundation,</hi> is imperfection, and, in its <hi>operation,</hi> vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The tendency of the rational ſoul is againſt both theſe. Reaſon requires no more, in any thing, to ſatisfie it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, than the matter, 'tis converſant with, is capable of affording. 'Twere to deny reaſon to be reaſon, to ſay, it required a knowledge of any thing, beyond the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and extent of it; and ſhould not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95663:64"/>acquieſce in the utmoſt evidence the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can afford. And therefore, in this preſent caſe of <hi>miracles,</hi> which are things done and paſt in other ages, a man, by his reaſon conſiders: Firſt: 'Tis poſſible ſuch things <hi>may</hi> have been done; I cannot po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, upon any good ground, determine they have <hi>not been done:</hi> becauſe 'tis poſſible (and muſt be ſo granted) that there <hi>may</hi> be a ſupreme power above and beyond the world, that <hi>may</hi> over-rule the world, as it pleaſes; and that becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing viſible, either in ſenſe or reaſon, that makes it <hi>impoſſible. Secondly,</hi> A man muſt conſider, by what waies and means he may reaſonably be aſſured and ſatisfied, that ſuch things actually were done. To wiſh to <hi>ſee</hi> a thing that is paſt, were childiſh; to call for any <hi>Mathematical demonſtration</hi> of it, were ridiculous; and both impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And therefore a man muſt come to know the fact of things, tranſacted before he was born, and of ſuch as he never ſaw, by the credible teſtimony of others; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, in ſome caſes, with the preſent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible remaining effects of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and 'tis not poſſible to know them any other way. The queſtion therefore, in this caſe, will be, [<hi>whether</hi> (upon the credit of others, by a general teſtimony
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95663:65"/>given to it) <hi>we may reaſonably believe a thing to have been, which we never ſaw? and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the truth of that which we our ſelves were not eye-witneſſes of?</hi>]</p>
            <p>For the making of this good, in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, let theſe things be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe that were <hi>eye-witneſſes,</hi> at the firſt, of any matter of fact, had as much certain aſſurance of it, as we have of any thing we now ſee. And therefore their report of it then cannot be falſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they deſigned it ſhould be ſo. For, whatever miſtakes they were capable of then, we are ſtill liable to the ſame now; and whatſoever, upon that account, will invalidate their teſtimony, will deſtroy the grounds of our own belief for ever. 'Tis no where neceſſary here to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, where the ultimate and ſupreme cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of mankind lyes, and whence it ariſes. To attribute ſo much to the ſenſes, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> does, it, doubtleſs, too much to debaſe that noble part of man, which is his reaſon, and to make way for all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable deceit. 'Tis obvious to us how commonly our ſenſes are miſtaken. Should a man take no other impreſſion of the Sun or the Moon into his underſtanding, but what he receives from his ſenſes, he would never know either of them to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95663:65"/>above <hi>half a yard diameter:</hi> if he did not conſider, that the diſtance of the object de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his ſight. Experience tells us how eaſie it is (were it not for the help of our underſtanding,) to repreſent falſe Images, that ſhall perfectly cheat the ſenſes. For when by a falſe light, or any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable way to the ſenſes, a thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me to be otherwiſe, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is; the underſtanding looks beyond the bare repreſentation, to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein the deceit lyes, and ſo rectifies the ſenſes. The underſtanding often does ſo, and is the ſupreme guide of them. Nor does it ever depart from their informations of ſenſe, where 'tis ſatisfied there is no <hi>accidental deceit</hi> put upon the ſenſes. In ſuch caſes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of ſenſe, and the reſults of right reaſon, are ever the ſame, becauſe both perfect in their kind. 'Twere a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of imbecillity in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to deny what we feel and ſee to be, and are ſure there is no deceit put upon us in ſo doing. In this caſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſayes rightly, <hi>relinquere ſenſum, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui rationem, debilitas eſt intellectus.</hi> And the Philoſopher was doubtleſs upon the right way of probation, that when one diſputed with him againſt motion, roſe up
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95663:66"/>himſelf, and walkt about before him. It ſeems therefore moſt reaſonable to believe, that the utmoſt of all humane certainty lies in the final reſults of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which takes in all the aſſiſtance of ſenſe, in ſuch things as are objects for both; and never differs from ſenſe, when 'tis no way deceived or abuſed; of which the underſtanding is ſtill the Judge. And in other things ſpeculative, and beyond the compaſs of ſenſe, it judges purely and ſingly by it ſelf. The faculty of our ſenſes, and that of the underſtandings, are both perfect in their kind. But the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſuperiour, and rectifies that deceit and miſtake the ſenſes are liable to: and, when 'tis ſatisfied the ſenſes are in their true and right exerciſe, and under no deceit, never differs from them; but the ſenſes and the underſtanding alwaies concurr. 'Twere to imagine, elſe, that God had made us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But ſo far as our preſent matter in hand is concerned, let us take things which way we will; thoſe that were, at the firſt, eye-witneſſes of any thing, and had their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings about them, were capable of making a judgement as certain, as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is capable of. And, when very many together agree to witneſs to the fact of a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95663:66"/>thing they ſaw, it muſt needs give all the cumulative advantage to the certainty of it, that poſſibly we can expect. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit therefore that we can only fear, in the teſtimony of others, is, an <hi>intention and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> they may poſſibly have to deceive and abuſe us, and to miſ-repreſent matter of fact to us. Now that which ought to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our minds in this caſe, (becauſe we have as much to our purpoſe as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter is capable of, and as our ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ought to require) in this: if we find, in any age, men of all intereſts and principles in that age, though never ſo different in themſelves, all concurring in a matter of fact; and many who were, in that very age, led by their intereſts and principles to oppoſe the truth of it, as carrying in it conſequences deſtructive to them; yet ſtill acknowledging that matter of fact; and juſtifying themſelves againſt the effects and products of it, by ſome collateral way, and never by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the fact: (which could ariſe from no other reaſon, but becauſe the fact was a thing ſo palpable, that the whole age would have confuted and ſhamed them, in the denial of it) and that the truth of ſuch a matter of fact hath deſcended to us with the concurrent teſtimony of all ages
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95663:67"/>ſince: 'tis not any way reaſonable to doubt of ſuch a thing. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here is all the evidence poſsible to be had about a thing paſt. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such as ought to make us certain of it; becauſe we muſt needs judge of other men that lived then, by our ſelves and others that live now, and by the conſtitution and frame of the world; and taking that, which is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible medium, in this caſe, to judge by, 'tis morally impoſsible ſuch a thing ſhould be a lye.</p>
            <p>And this will appear to be the very caſe about <hi>miracles,</hi> and the fact of them. For we have not only ſuch a teſtimony about them, as we have that there was ſuch a place as <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſuch a man as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar:</hi> (becauſe perhaps no mans intereſt ever lay to deny ſuch a thing; but as it would have been generally ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and preſently confuted, ſo haply it would not have been to any purpoſe to any one man, in his own particular, to have attempted ſuch a negative.) But, in this caſe, 'twas the intereſt of many, (where-ever miracles were wrought to eſtabliſh a new Religion,) to deny the fact of them; and nothing could have been more eaſie, nor more ſure of ſucceſs, if there had been really no ſuch thing.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95663:67"/>And yet we find the miracles wrought by Chriſt [not to mention any of the other miracles than have been in the world] deſcend to us with the univerſal teſtimony of that age; not only of thoſe that were converted by them, and friends to them; but by the greateſt oppoſers of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion introduced by them, both of Jews and Heathens. <hi>Joſephus</hi> a famous and learned Jew, in the 18th. Book of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and <hi>chap.</hi> 14. tells the world this concerning Chriſt; ſayes he, <hi>At that time was Jeſus, a wiſe man, if it be lawfull to call him a man: for he was the performer of divers wonderful works, and the inſtructor or thoſe who willingly entertain the truth: and he drew unto him divers Jews and Greeks to be his followers.</hi> This was Chriſt, who being accuſed by the Princes of our Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pilate,</hi> and afterwards condemned to the Croſs by him; yet did not thoſe who followed him from the beginning, forbear to love him for the ignominy of his death: for he appeared unto them alive the third day after, according as he divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had before teſtified the ſame, and divers other wonderful things of him; and from that time forward the race of the Chriſtians, who have derived their name from him, hath never ceaſed.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:95663:68"/>
            <p>Not only <hi>Joſephus,</hi> but the Jews general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were forced to acknowledge the fact of Chriſts miracles; but they tell you he did them not by his own power, but by ſome Magick Art which he brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or by vertue of their <hi>Cabala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology, <hi>ch.</hi> 21. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe miraculous paſſages that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the death of Chriſt, ſayes he to the Heathen <hi>Romans; theſe things cannot be ſuſpected, ſeeing your own calanders have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked them, and your ſelves retain the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony thereof in your own Regiſters:</hi> And a little after, (ſpeaking of the miracles of Chriſt,) ſayes he, <hi>Pilate wrote all this Hiſtory to the Emperour Tiberius; whereupon the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars themſelves had worhipped our Maſter, if their Government in ſo doing, had been conſiſtent with the men of this world, and Chriſtians permitted to have been ſaluted Caeſars.</hi> There is nothing more plain in Hiſtory, than that under the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate, the ſeveral Lieutenants of their Provinces did ſend conſtant Regiſters of their acts, and of all the moſt material paſſages that happened, to the Emperours, and ſo <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate</hi> ſent a Regiſter of his, to the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> wherein he gave an account to Chriſt, and his miracles: this is alſo clear and evident from <hi>Justin
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95663:68"/>Martyrs</hi> ſecond Apology for the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the Emperour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> wherein, endeavouring to perſwade him to believe the miracles of Chriſt, he ſhews him how they were of old foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and to convince him they actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were, he refers him to the acts of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> then regiſtred at <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> again in the firſt chapter of his Apology, tells us plainly, that the account that came out of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> of Chriſts miracles, was ſo powerfull at <hi>Rome,</hi> and made ſuch impreſſions there, that the Emperour moved the Senate earneſtly to embrace that Religion, who gave no other reaſon for their refuſal of it, but that they had not themſelves before it was propoſed to them, approved of it: and for a while the Emperour perſiſted in his opinion, threatning pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the accuſers of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Celſus</hi> the great ſtickler againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, confeſſeth the fact of Chriſts miracles, as may be ſeen in <hi>Origens</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Book againſt him; only he does as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, father them upon the power of the Devil: to which <hi>Origen</hi> largely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>if the Devil do at any time counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit miracles,</hi> ſaith he, from the impoſtures and counterfeits we may infer, that there
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95663:69"/>are <hi>true miracles wrought by a divine power.</hi> But in this caſe, if ever there were a miracle wrought [let it be fathered upon what men pleaſe] they cannot deny but that there is a power ſupreme to the world, and that muſt produce ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; and there needs no better acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement than that, to lead men directly to God.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe we had no other account of theſe miracles, but from the Chriſtians themſelves that then lived; and ſuch whoſe intereſt it was to defend them; who can imagine that men ſhould tell a notorious lye in the face of that very age, when it was in the power of every man to contradict it? and that it ſhould uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally paſs without controul? Is it a thing credible, that the Chriſtians then, ſhould chiefly inſiſt and juſtifie themſelves upon a matter of fact that was falſe, and that every body might then know to be ſo: it had been a readier way to have brought ruine and deſtruction upon them, than have proved a means to gain them favour and protection: if we conſult the ſeveral Apologies [the firſt of which was <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi>] the Chriſtians then made for themſelves. Upon ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to the Emperours, and to the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95663:69"/>Senate, we ſhall find one of the chiefeſt foundations they bottomed the Chriſtian Religion upon, and their own juſtification in the profeſſion of it, was the miracles that were openly and viſibly wrought for the firſt ſettlement, and after confirmation of it in the world: And the effect of ſuch Apologies, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writers plentifully inform us, was, that the Chriſtians very often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained favour, and thereby procured reſt and eaſe to themſelves, from their ſore and grievous perſecutions: Now 'tis not to be imagined, but that if the fact of ſuch miracles had been falſe, and the Chriſtians had made ſuch a lye their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, their enemies would have been thereby rather inraged than appeaſed; and it would certainly have haſtened their ruine, rather than have procured their liberty.</p>
            <p>But methinks that which ought abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to ſatisfie any reaſonable man of this truth, that there were miracles wrought in thoſe primitive times of the Goſpel, is, that we not only find the Chriſtian Writers in that age <hi>una voce,</hi> proving the miracles of Chriſt to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, by teſtimonies from amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own acknowledged
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95663:70"/>records, and the conſent of the whole age, both friends and foes, wherein they were wrought to the truth of them, as hath been ſhewed; but alſo we find the loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crying out to the Heathens, that if any doubted of the miracles wrought by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, if they would come amongſt the Chriſtians, they would then ſhew them actually and viſibly, miracles wrought before their own eyes, by the power of Chriſt every day: that is worth conſideration, with what wonderful and general triumph they defend their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and oppoſe the Heathens with this challenge; and with an offer to convince them by their own eye-ſight of the miracles that were frequently wrought amongſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> ſpeaks very largely and fully about this matter, and tells him, <hi>We that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, crucified under</hi> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate, <hi>adjure all Devils and unclean ſpirits, and have them obedient to us. You may know that Jeſus died, roſe from the dead, and aſcended into Heaven, by that which is done in your ſight by his power; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils tremble at his Name; and being adjured thereby, are overcome:</hi> with much more to the ſame purpoſe; profeſſing the miracles
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95663:70"/>that were every day wrought in the fight and view of all men. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> in his Book <hi>adverſus Haereſes, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 36. ſpeaking of miracles then wrought by the name and power of Chriſt, hath theſe words, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his Name, they who are truly his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, receiving grace from him, are inabled to benefit the reſt of men: for ſome caſt out Devils moſt really and truly, ſo that they who are cleanſed from thoſe unclean ſpirits, do often believe themſelves, and are in the Church: ſome have the knowledge of things to come, viſions, and prophetical readings: and others by the impoſition of hands cure thoſe that are ſick of any infirmity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them perfectly whole: And even now as we have ſaid, both the dead have riſen, and many years have remained with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> cryes out to him, <hi>If thou wilt not believe other miracles, yet believe what thou ſeeſt now; for 'tis the magnificent work of Jeſus, to heal even to this day in the name of Jeſus whom God pleaſeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> is ſo plain and poſitive in this matter, that in his famous Apology for the Chriſtians before mentioned, he tells the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators, that if they pleaſed to try the truth of that miraculous power that was then in the Church, they would ſee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95663:71"/>it openly execiſed when they pleaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own tribunals, in the 23 <hi>chap.</hi> of his Apology.</p>
            <p>'Tis wholly incredible to believe the world ſhould be univerſally deceived in theſe things; and that no body [no not ſuch who were highly concerned to do it, and engaged by a contrary Religion, to overthrow a Religion chiefly eſtabliſhed and upheld by ſuch miracles] ſhould contradict the fact of them, and diſcover the cheat, if they were meerly fictitious? There ſeems to be a king of infallibility in this circumſtanced teſtimony about a bare matter of fact. For, whether ſuch a thing were done or no, or whether there was ſuch a man, or ſuch a place or no, is not capable of any defilement by conveyance. 'Tis not like a <hi>ſtory,</hi> which is capable of all kind of alterations, additions and diminutions: but 'tis ſuch a thing, as muſt be either an intire poſitive truth, or an intire falſhood. If any man, in this age, ſhould pretend to work a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> it would be the buſineſs of almoſt every man to diſcover the truth of it: and if he were found an Impoſtor, and that truly and really there was no ſuch thing, how many would ſtrive to proclaim the cheat firſt? And the teſtimony of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95663:71"/>whole age would be his executioner. Nor have we only this moral certainty of the fact of theſe miracles; but the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that <hi>important occaſion,</hi> upon the account of which they were wrought; and very good reaſon to think, they ſhould be wrought upon it; which was, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in the world. To put an end not only to <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> and all <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> worſhip: but to determine that Eccleſiaſtical Policy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which had been, by the like extraodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary miracles, before ſettled in the world. And that ſuch a thing as the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was then introduced, we have not only the ſame general concurring teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; but alſo we our ſelves, at this time, ſee the effects, products, and continuance of it, daily before our eyes; which is the utmoſt evidence we can poſſibly have of any thing tranſacted and paſſed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He that, upon no terms, will admit us to be <hi>morally certain</hi> of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, by the teſtimony of the age when it was done, (for if ever he will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, he muſt in this caſe, where all things concurre;) he muſt (with great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, and without the leaſt colour of reaſon, or certain knowledge of his own,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95663:72"/>to contradict it,) put the <hi>fool</hi> and the <hi>lye</hi> upon all men of all ſorts in an age: and, of neceſſity, render them ſo <hi>fooliſhly weak,</hi> as not to be able to judge whether a thing be done or not done; or elſe ſo <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly falſe</hi> to all mankind, as to agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to convey a <hi>lye</hi> down to them, and impoſe an eminent cheat upon them. This, as it is, in the reaſon of the thing, abſurd to think, (when there is no viſible reaſon why they ſhould do ſo, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apparent reaſons why they ſhould not do ſo) ſo our experience tell us, that there was never yet any ſuch thing done in the world. There never was an offer made to cheat the world with a matter of fact, but, in that very age, 'twas diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and made appear: and (together with the ſtory of the cheat) that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it likewiſe ſo to be, hath been conveyed to all future times. There have been but three Religions in the world, that ever pretended to a Syſteme of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatual revelation: which are, the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Mahumetan Religion.</hi> The matters of fact of both the former, have had all the concurrence of humane teſtimony: and no man can ſhew, that in the ages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were tranſacted, they were ever
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95663:72"/>denyed by any. The laſt, which is the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, was openly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in that age, to be a <hi>cheat:</hi> and the world is as well aſſured of a <hi>Mahomets</hi> being an Impoſtor, as they are of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he framed: and that by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the age wherein he lived. Does not the ſtory of that age tell us, how he began his Religion? What advantage he took by the diſeaſe he had of the <hi>Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs,</hi> to tell men whenever he was in a <hi>fit,</hi> that he was in a <hi>rapture,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Angel Gabriel?</hi> How one <hi>Sergius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (an Apoſtate and diſcontented Monk) coming to him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to form the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> by adding ſuch matters, out of the Old and New. Teſtaments, to his own devices, as might bring in <hi>Gentiles, Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> to his Religion? The ſtory of that age aſſures us fully of the whole <hi>cheat</hi> of his life; and of his promiſe at his death; (in ſome imitation, no doubt, of Chriſt) to riſe again within <hi>four daies.</hi> In which time he became putrified and noiſome; and his Diſciples, at laſt, forced to bury him. The wiſeſt and beſt men, at that very time, oppoſed him, and made his drunkenneſs, and horrible debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notorious and evident. Whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95663:73"/>the principles of his Religion, will plainly enough perceive, the deſign was to ſet up himſelf, and engage all parties to him. The <hi>Alchoran</hi> is, by ſome, rightly abridged into theſe eight principles. 1. <hi>Every one ought to believe that God is a great God, and Mahomet is his Prophet,</hi> Abraham <hi>the friend of God,</hi> Moſes <hi>the Meſſenger of God, and Chriſt the Breath of God; of whom the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>grew with child by ſmelling a Roſe, and was deliver'd of him at her breaſts.</hi> 2. <hi>Every man ought to marry, to increaſe the Sectaries of</hi> Mahomet. 3. <hi>Every man muſt give of his wealth to the poor.</hi> 4. <hi>Every man muſt make his prayers five times a day.</hi> 5. <hi>Every man muſt keep a Lent one month in a year.</hi> 6. <hi>Muſt be obedient to his Parents.</hi> 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill. And</hi> 8. <hi>Do unto others as thou wouldeſt be done unto thy ſelf.</hi> 'Tis not hard to perceive, whence this counterfeit coin was fetch; &amp; where the legitimate and original ſtamp is to be found. He would induce the good of all Religions, ſo he might be the chief Prophet. The whole buſineſs then of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> was a grand notorious cheat. And though it has poſſeſſed ſo much of the world ſince, yet we have adundant aſſurance from the teſtimony of the ſame age, wherein he lived, that it was ſo, and the particulars of it exactly handed down to us.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:95663:73"/>
            <p>We are able to trace all falſe Religions and pretended Deities to their original. The word is filled with a ſufficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the deceit and fabulouſneſs of them all. To give one clear inſtance of it; <hi>Saturn</hi> was the moſt ancient God the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had amongſt them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes this of him: <hi>You have</hi> (ſayes he, ſpeaking to the <hi>Romans</hi>) <hi>no God more ancient than</hi> Saturn: yet <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Tullus, Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Severus, Cornelius Nepos, nor any other Hiſtorian, ever ſpake of him otherwiſe than a man. If we ſeek for proofs drawn out of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Records and Monuments, we cannot meet with faithfuller, or more certain, than here in</hi> Italy <hi>it ſelf: where we learn, that</hi> Saturn, <hi>after many voyages, landed in this Province, while he was coming from</hi> Greece; <hi>and was received by one</hi> Janus. <hi>The Mountain, where he dwelt, was called</hi> Saturnien: <hi>The City he founded carries, even until now, the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation. It was he who firſt found out the invention of Tables; and ſigning or making mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the image of Princes: from whence it comes, that the publick treaſure is placed by you in his Temple. Now if</hi> Saturn <hi>were a man, he was the ſon of another man: and being his father was a man, you cannot ſay, He was the Son of Heaven and Earth. But</hi> Saturn, <hi>in perſon, ſurprizing the Inhabitants
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95663:74"/>of ſeveral places, where he landed; and they not knowing whence he came, paſſed after for a divine perſon, and a God.</hi> Tertul. Apol. chap. 8. In the ſame manner, in his ninth chapter, he ſhews them the original of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Bacchus, Ceres, Minerva,</hi> and the reſt of their Gods: and how they came firſt to be ſo accounted: and tells them, [<hi>If</hi> Bacchus <hi>were therefore made a God with them, becauſe he firſt taught them to plant Vines, they uſed</hi> Lucullus <hi>ill, in not making him a God too, who firſt planted Cherry-trees in</hi> Italy, <hi>and brought them from the Kingdom of</hi> Pontus—] So clear and full an account have we of all thoſe things; and ſo little reaſon has any man to be deceived with thoſe things; nor can he be deceived with them, unleſs he have a mind ſo to be.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be ſuppoſed, that in matters <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable,</hi> 'tis much more eaſie to deceive men that are weak and ignorant, by impoſing upon them, than in any bare matter of fact; wherein every man, even the meaneſt, may confute a falſhood; there the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to be impoſed upon. If all the cunningeſt men in this age ſhould contrive to let Poſterity know, that <hi>London was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver burnt, but ſtands juſt as it did twenty years ago:</hi> 'Twere not in their power to make Poſterity ſwallow down ſuch a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95663:74"/>by perſwading this age univerſally, without any contradiction, to convey it as a truth down to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To deny all kind of certainty from moral teſtimony, is, to deny our ſelves the benefit of any part of the world, or of any thing done in any part of the world, at any time in the world; but juſt what we our <hi>ſelves ſaw</hi> in the times and places wherein we lived. No one age can be of any uſe to another, in any record of it; nor any one man of uſe to another, by his credit, in ſuch a way. For the ſame reaſon, that will make a man not to believe others, will be as good to them, not to believe him: and ſo all mankind muſt <hi>live upon their eye-ſight;</hi> and he that wants that, muſt neceſſarily be a perfect <hi>Sceptick.</hi> This does not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all confidence in preſent ſociety, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if I cannot reſt aſſured of what all men generally, in an age paſt, have affirmed, and no man has contradicted in that age, nor ſince; I can much leſs be aſſured of what any number of men ſhall tell me now; when I do not know, but that it may be contradicted by ſome that know otherwiſe, before this age paſs over.) But it doe alſo interrupt the ſatisfaction, that all men have about <hi>themſelves</hi> and their own relations. For, what have we but a moral aſſurance
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95663:75"/>from a concurring teſtimony, with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effects of it, that ſuch a man is my Father; or ſuch a woman my Mother; or ſuch perſons my relations; or that ſuch a Country is my native Country? All men generally reſt ſatisfied, and credit humane teſtimony with concurring effects, as they have good reaſon, about ſuch things; and yet there may poſſibly be deceits here; and a good account given, both how, and why they may be ſo. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo rare and unuſual, and alſo <hi>ſo improbable,</hi> they do not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the general ſatisfaction mankind has about thoſe things. But when a whole age agree to aſſure us, by their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of a matter of fact they ſaw, and were eye-witneſſes of; there can be no reaſon aſſigned of a deceit or miſtake in them, further than what all men are liable to, in the trueſt exerciſes of their ſenſes, and their reaſon, in their then judging of it, nor in their conveying of it to us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis not to be conceived, but that if any falſhood, in any age, had been made publick, many (at leaſt thoſe whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it was to do it,) would have openly diſcovered and contradicted it. And to thi k a whole age (men of all ſorrs and parties, ſome againſt their own intereſt,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95663:75"/>and others to no purpoſe at all) ſhould agree to abuſe poſterity with an abſolute untruth, is a thing beyond the compaſs of all humane credit.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He that will deny, that a man (by the exerciſe of his reaſon, in comparing things together, and judging of moral circumſtances,) can arrive at ſuch an aſſurance, as may and ought to ſatisfie a rational man, about things which he never ſaw; he muſt deny one of the nobleſt, and moſt uſefull effects of the rational ſoul; which is, <hi>by rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries and concluſions, to aſcertain it ſelf of things, that can no way be the object of ſenſe.</hi> No man ever came to know, the world is round, by ſenſible experience: nor to foretell an <hi>ecclipſe</hi> of the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came to paſs. Such things are ſingly the deductions of reaſon, without any aſſiſtance of ſenſe. If no certain conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be made from any humane teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony however circumſtanced, no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment nor Laws can be fixed beyond an age. For if men give no credit to any thing but what they ſee, every age muſt either undo, or do over again, whatever the precedent age did. Nor can men ever come to oblige their ſucceſſors; becauſe the validity of that obligation muſt needs
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95663:76"/>depend upon the credit of a humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance. The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> therefore is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in his negative about this matter: the truth of which ought to be eſtabliſhed, not only upon the preſent point, to prove that there is a God, by the truth of the miracles, which none but God could work; but alſo for the great advantage we have by it, in aſſuring us of the fact of ſupernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations. Which, be ſides all the divine evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they have peculiar to themſelves, have alſo ſuch a <hi>credible teſtimony</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as, upon that account, makes them deſcend beyond the preſent age wherein they were firſt delivered; and with apparent reaſon to reach us now, as well as thoſe who were the eye-witneſſes of them at firſt.</p>
            <p>A fifth Argument to prove, againſt an Atheiſt, that God made the world, is this; <hi>That the preſent frame and poſture of the world is ſuch, that the notion of a Deity, and a power above the world is of abſolute neceſſity to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it.</hi> The Atheiſt, in denying the Being of God, denyes the well-being; yea, deſtroyes the being of the world it ſelf. Though he can conſiſt without the world, yet the world cannot ſubſiſt without him. Were there no power above the world, to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95663:76"/>influence it, (the ſenſe of which did reſtrain and oblige men) we ſhould ſoon experiment what the world would come to. For the making this truth more evident, let us but imagine a <hi>whole Country of Atheiſts,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved nothing above nor beyond this world: and believed themſelves (as they muſt needs) to be the top of the world, that owed no ſubjection to any thing; and then take a view of thoſe conſequences which muſt neceſſarily attend ſuch an <hi>Atheiſtical croud,</hi> and by that we ſhall clearly diſcern, of what abſolute neceſſity the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of God is to the ſupport of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There <hi>could never come to be ſuch a thing as a ſenſe of good and evil amongſt them.</hi> That's inconſiſtent with Atheiſm. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of good and evil, is a principle within us relating to ſomewhat above us. The notion of that once taken away, the diſtinction of good and evil muſt needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: and the ſupreme ruling principle of every man can be no other, but the <hi>pleaſing himſelf,</hi> and doing whatſoever his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination dictates to him. Suppoſe men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lawleſs, and without any reſtraint within them, and you can never imagine them to come under any Law, but their own unruly appetite: and ſo, the whole of ſuch a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95663:77"/>company muſt be inſlaved to the will one of another, and to each individual mans will, ſo far as he has power to accompliſh it. 'Tis the diſtinction between good and evil, that keeps the world from being a heap of rubbiſh and confuſion. And no ſuch diſtinction can ever be ſuppoſed to haven its riſe from a man himſelf, unleſs he had a ſuperiour, and were made with ſuch a diſtinguiſhing principle. And that for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Good and evil can never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in men, if there be no God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has nothing it can referre to. A diſtinction of good and evil in a man does neceſſarily relate to a perfect and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme good, as a Rule by which 'tis to be tryed. We cannot conceive how the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good and evil ſhould ever have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted in the minds of men, if there had not been an eternal and ſupreme rectitude. Had there not been a Being infinitely and originally good, the denomination of good could never have been in the world: nor could we any other way, ever have known what had been meant by that we call evil. There muſt needs have been a ſupreme ſtandard of theſe things: and in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of good and evil, 'tis an infinite <hi>Rectum, that is index ſui &amp; obliqui.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:95663:77"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the diſtinction of good and evil in men is a thing perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to reward and puniſhment; which none can be the ultimate diſpenſer of to himſelf: becauſe no man can be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do any thing againſt himſelf, when he is a Law to himſelf; nor to condemn any thing in himſelf, as evil, when he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. Nor, on the other hand, is it proper to ſay, <hi>a man can reward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> becauſe he can add nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. All reward is an expectation beyond our ſelves. When we ſay an action carries its own reward, 'tis becauſe of the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction it gives us in hope of a reward from above.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If a man be ſo ſupreme (as the Atheiſt will make him,) to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all above him, there can never be poſſibly made by him any diſtinction in his actions: becauſe he would be then under no Law but himſelf; and ſo could never come to break any Law by himſelf. He that is his own Law can never come under any tranſgreſſion: nor can ſuch a thing as evil ever happen to be in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Being. No man can ever come to ſay, he does ill, without he be under the Law of a ſuperiour. By theſe things, 'tis plain, if there be no God, there can
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95663:78"/>be no ſuch thing as a diſtinction of good and evil amongſt men: and without that, 'tis obvious into what dirt and meanneſs the whole world will crumble. There can be no ſuch thing as juſt and unjuſt; no ſuch thing as property; no ſuch thing as right in <hi>meum &amp; tuum.</hi> For all theſe things, and every other thing that is either decent or uſeful, is graffed upon that diſtinguiſhing taſte of good and evil, God has, by our <hi>firſt make,</hi> indued us withall: ſo that, without that, no man can pretend right to his life or his eſtate, when another, that is a perfect Law to himſelf, has an opportunity and a will to take it away.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Conſequence attending a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Atheiſts without a God in their thoughts, is this; <hi>They could never come to be ſecured one to another in ſuch a way, as is abſolutely neceſſary to uphold the frame of the world, and to keep men ſafe in ſociety and converſe together.</hi> If there were no ground for any truſt amongſt mankind, nor any way to create ſuch a ſecurity amongſt men, as that they might be reaſonably aſcertained one to another; it were not poſſible they ſhould ever come into any <hi>political Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or live in a moral converſe quietly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but muſt perpetually abide in a ſtate of war, and ſtill recur to open force.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95663:78"/>The world it ſelf is ſo framed, that men cannot live and converſe together, without putting <hi>ſome truſt</hi> each in other. All the matters of the world cannot be made ſure. <hi>Truſt</hi> is the firſt and chief ground of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane converſe. Without that, each man, when he met another, would ſuppoſe he met his enemy; and think himſelf ſafe in nothing, but the power of his own defence. Now the great and only foundation, upon which all <hi>truſt</hi> amongſt mankind is erected, is a general acknowledgement of a ſupreme Power above them, that perfectly knows their actions, and has power to reward and puniſh them: and a principle in men, which we call conſcience, that ſteers them with ſuch an apprehenſion. If there be nothing <hi>above men</hi> to puniſh them, of which they ſtand in awe, nor any innate principle <hi>within them,</hi> to determine their own actions about good and evil, it were abſurd and fooliſh ever to truſt any man; becauſe there could be no viſible ground for ſuch a truſt. An <hi>Atheiſt</hi> that ſayes, There is no God above him, nor any conſcience within him, muſt needs make himſelf his <hi>own Law;</hi> and, by that, makes himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any truſt from another. For the great reaſon of truſt lies in mens acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging principles, that will bring them to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95663:79"/>deny their own intereſt, when juſtice and truth calls for it. The acknowledgement of God, and the exerciſes of conſcience, gives men a ground of ſecurity one in another: that when mens private intereſts oppoſe their doing what is juſt, and there is no power to force them; yet the fear of God, and the excitements of conscience may over-rule them. 'Tis not to be doubted, but that the general awe of a God in the world, is the <hi>invisible guard of it;</hi> and that grand pillar, by which the world is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and made to conſiſt within it ſelf. Upon the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> principles, all the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truſt and ſecurity are taken away. There can be no ſuch thing as an oath, no ſuch thing as a promiſe, nor a ground for any ſort of engagements, where there is no God: for in all thoſe caſes men appeal from themſelves to the Judgement of God. Who will ever truſt: another, when he is his own Law, and can offend none but himſelf? Nay, can never offend himſelf? For where a man is <hi>supreme,</hi> and is a Law to himſelf, he can never come to do any thing but <hi>what is right.</hi> Amongſt pure Atheiſts there cannot be any ſort of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence created. And that confidence man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind put one in another is the very origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſement of all government, all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95663:79"/>all trade, and all other converſe of men together. Take away God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience once out of the world, and no man can be obliged to do, nor ever will do, anything but juſt what he pleaſeth.'Twere a fond thing to think any man ſhould; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not the leaſt reaſon why he ſhould. And in that caſe, no man would ever truſt to any engagements from another, becauſe there could be <hi>nothing obligatory</hi> in the making of them, and ſo not the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the keeping of them; unleſs you will admit of a ſupream power above men, to whoſe judgement and determination they all refer, and acknowledge themſelves ſubjected; 'tis not poſſible to frame any ground, upon which mankind ſhould be ever obliged one to another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>There could never poſſibly be any government ſettled amongſt Atheiſts;</hi> which is the great diſtinguiſher of <hi>men</hi> in their <hi>ſocieties,</hi> from <hi>beaſts</hi> in their herds. Nay, without government, men would be worſe than beaſts one to another, by how much the more knowledge and invention they are poſſeſſed with to do miſchief. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out government, all men live in a ſtate of war. Every man has a right to what he can get, and no right to any thing that he cannot keep. One ſayes truly, <hi>That
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95663:80"/>force and fraud muſt needs be the two cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vertues of ſuch a condition.</hi> There never can be any government ſettled amongſt ſuch men, who overthrow the great and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme rule over the world. Remove God once out of Heaven, and there never will be any Gods upon Earth. Mankind would never agree to ſubject themſelves to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but that there is ſomewhat of the <hi>image of God</hi> in it, to whom they pay a natural homage. Theſe things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing make it evident, there can never be any government ſettled amongſt meer Atheiſts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By their principles, the end of government is extinguiſhed. For the end of government (as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> well deſcribes it) is <hi>reward and puniſhment.</hi> But where there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of a God, there can be no ſuch thing as good and evil: and where there is not a diſtinction of good and evil, there can be no place for reward and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. For, being a <hi>terrour to evil doers, and an incouragement to them that do well</hi> (the great hinge upon which all government hangs) are thoſe principles God has, by natural light, placed in men, to direct them how 'tis to be exerciſed and exerted. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> By the Atheiſts tenents, that which ſhould chiefly uphold and ſupport the being
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95663:80"/>of government in the world, is razed and demoliſhed: and that is, a <hi>primary ſubjection to God,</hi> which begets a <hi>ſecondary ſubjection to men</hi> as repreſenting him, and exerciſing his authority amongſt them. He that thinks himſelf his <hi>own God,</hi> will be ſure to be his <hi>own King.</hi> If there be nothing above the world, <hi>man,</hi> I am ſure, is the ſupreameſt part of the world: and ſo muſt needs come to think himſelf an abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent being. And he that is ſo, can never make a diſtinction in any action, nor never ſubject himſelf to any perſon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is his own Law; and that ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, which the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould exerciſe, every Atheiſt carries in his own breaſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There can be no ground for ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and inferiority, nor any ſecurity given between men, that ſhould create ſuch a relation amongſt them. No ground at all, I ſay, for it; for, men that are lawleſs (which all men muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be, if they have nothing above them) can never come to be governed. This the Atheiſt tacitly confeſſeth, when he tells us, that <hi>men invented the ſtory of the Gods, and frighted men therewith, that they might keep the world in ſubjection, and bring men under obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to government.</hi> It could never enter into mens minds to ſubject themſelves, if
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95663:81"/>they thought themſelves ſupreme in their being, and had no Law but their own wills. If mans nature had not ſomewhat of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it to a ſupreme being above him, and inherent principles obliging him how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf toward God, and toward the reſt of the world, government could never have been introduced, nor thought of. Nor can there be the leaſt mutual ſecurity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Governours and governed, where no God is admitted. For, as I proved before, 'tis an acknowledging of God, in his ſupreme judgement over the word, that is the ground of an <hi>oath,</hi> and upon which, the validity of all humane engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depends. All people in the world, have ſome God or other, by whom they put a ſanction upon all their ſolemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements one to another; and wherein they acquieſce as the higheſt ſecurity man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is capable of. And although men are ſometimes ſo vile as to break them, yet they thereby render themſelves liable to all the hatred, reproach and contempt imaginable: and declare themſelves the publick enemies both of God and man. And very often God makes them in this world the viſible objects of his juſtice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the Atheiſt objet againſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95663:81"/>this and ſay, <hi>'Tis poſſible for men that deny there is a God, or any ſuch thing as a diſtinction between good and evil, for their intereſt ſake, to erect a government over them, and ſubmit themſelves to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that admit the intereſt of an Atheiſt ſhould incline him to government, yet his principles are deſtructive to it, and make it impoſſible to be attained. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> There can be no rules for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a caſe, neither how any man ſhall govern, nor how any man ſhall obey. For where there are no principles, neither by ſupernatural revelation from God, nor by the light of nature in men, to declare the ends and uſes of government, (as in this caſe, amongſt avowed Atheiſts who ſay there is no God, there can be none;) there can be nothing but abſolute will and pleaſure: which can never come to be exerciſed, but where there is the greateſt ſtrength. For if one mans will be as perfect and as obſolute as anothers, he will never ſubmit to the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but when he is forced to it. And let us but imagine what a thing ſoveraign Power would be in the hands of men, where no God is owned, nor any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of good and evil acknowledged: it would neceſſarily induce a ſlavery and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95663:82"/>far worſe than what any one beaſt is at any time in to another. The truth is, that where there are no rules or principles, to make a diſtinction between men, and to be a ground of ſuperiority and inferiority, 'tis not poſſible either to erect or to uphold ſuch a kind of conſtitution as government, any other way, than by down-right force.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, 'Tis not poſſible to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the grand fundamental of all government (which is, that all private perſonal intereſt ſhould voluntarily yield to the good of the whole) ſhould ever come to be eſtabliſhed among a company of perfect Atheiſts. 'Tis not to be imagined, that where a man is ſupreme in himſelf, and has no principle but himſelf, that ever he ſhould conſent, in any caſe, to deny himſelf, to his own apparent prejudice. There can be no reaſon thought of, why he ſhould do it, but for intereſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: for he can have no other thing to be guided by. And <hi>bare intereſt</hi> will never teach any man <hi>actual ſelf denial,</hi> either for the good of another, or for the good of the whole. No man (without ſome conſcience of obeying thoſe that are over him, and without ſome natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that 'tis his duty to prefer the whole of others before himſelf) will ever
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95663:82"/>depart from his own particular intereſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any notion of the publick whatſoever. Abſtract God, and conſcience of well and ill-doing from men, and no mans reaſon but will make himſelf his ſupreme Law; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him to do any thing againſt himſelf, upon any collateral ground whatever. Yielding, in a mans own particular, to the good of the whole, is a noble beam of natural light, ſpringing from God; and from that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of good and ill, men bring into the world with them, in reference to their duty toward others, and the reſt of the world. God deſigned man in his <hi>make,</hi> for a ſociable creature, and that men ſhould live quietly together; and that, in order to it, they ſhould carry about them natural obligations one to another. But no man, that has himſelf for his higheſt principle, (which every Atheiſt muſt have) will ever prefer the good of any, or of all men, before his own. So that the Atheiſt, in denying the being of God, deſtroyes, neceſſarily, all thoſe principles, which pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to his being: And, by that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes all thoſe principles) by which the world is upheld and maintained.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſeem, with undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to enlighten us in our way to God:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95663:83"/>and to ſhew us, what a <hi>dark Chaos of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and confuſion</hi> the whole of an Atheiſts principles appear to the eye of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Which way ever we look, whether to the riſe and beginning of the world, to the matter and parts of it, the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, either to the being or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of it, we ſtill find our reaſon leading us ſafely to God. We find how neceſſary the acknowledgement of his being is to our own, and to ſecure the political frame and compoſition of the world. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his firſt book <hi>De nat. Deor.</hi> ſpeaks largely and excellently upon this ſubject. <hi>Take away</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Being and Providence of God out of the world, and there follows nothing but confuſion: not only Piety and Sanctity is gone; but all Faith, Vertue, and humane Societies too.</hi> And of the ſame mind were <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> who have largely diſcourſed this ſtate, than the increaſe of Atheiſm; nor can any thing prove more deſtructive to all humane converſe and ſociety, and what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relates both to the being and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of the world. The Atheiſt, as he is the greateſt <hi>Traitor</hi> to the higheſt King above; ſo his principles carry in them the moſt dangerous and deſtructive treaſon to all his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> here below.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:95663:83"/>
            <p>The great Objection the Atheiſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally makes againſt the whole of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is this; ſayes he, <hi>No man ever ſaw the God you talk of; all diſcourſes about ſuch an infinite being as you talk of, are meer fables and ſtories, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms in mens brains; nor can you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conceive any thing of him. 'Tis more ſuitable to reaſon a great deal to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve only what I ſee, than to offer my ſelf to be poſſeſſed with a belief of what I never ſaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, that the Atheiſt boaſts of as his chief ſupport, he will find to fail him, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him both groſly <hi>diſingenious,</hi> and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably <hi>unreaſonable. Firſt, diſingenious</hi> and falſe to himſelf; for the Atheiſt himſelf, upon his own principles, is forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>he believes things he never ſaw;</hi> and cannot himſelf deny it. Take the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean Atheiſt;</hi> did he ever, I wonder, ſee the <hi>Atoms</hi> he tells us of? <hi>Lucretius</hi> and all the <hi>Atomiſts</hi> confeſs, that the buſineſs of the <hi>Atoms</hi> is a thing, that does not fall under the perception of ſenſe. Did he ever view their <hi>motion,</hi> by which they cauſed the world? Did he ever take a view of that <hi>vacuum,</hi> that <hi>ultra-mundan-ſpace,</hi> where theſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95663:84"/>Atoms are treaſured up? Did either of their great Maſters, <hi>Democritus,</hi> or <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> ever aſſure the world that they <hi>ſaw</hi> theſe things? or were eye-witneſſes to what they would have others believe? Or was any man ever yet heard of that did ſee them? Was there ever any ſuch tradition in the world, that they were ſeen? Take the other <hi>ſect of Atheiſts,</hi> that would have the world to be <hi>eternal,</hi> juſt as it is: and let them be aſked, can they have any <hi>ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> certainty of the worlds eternity? can they know any thing that way, in the age paſt before them? much leſs what was eternal? Is not the <hi>worlds being eternal,</hi> as much a deduction from bare diſcourſe and reaſoning, as <hi>that there is a ſupreme Being?</hi> If the Atheiſt reſolve to believe nothing but what he <hi>ſees,</hi> unleſs the world were made over and over, no man can ever believe it, but thoſe that juſt ſaw it made. Take all the Sectators of Atheiſm together, and let me aſk them this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whether they can refuſe to believe (without offering violence to their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) that there is a principle of motion in themſelves, and many other parts of the world? And yet I am ſure, they never <hi>ſaw</hi> it. Let any man tell me, whether ever he ſaw that principle that acts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95663:84"/>call it the ſoul, or what you will. Did he ever yet <hi>ſee</hi> his own thoughts? And yet we are not more ſure of any one thing in this world, than that we <hi>think:</hi> be ſure of any thing. God has left us the nobleſt part of our ſelves <hi>inviſible:</hi> (which yet we cannot refuſe to believe, unleſs we ceaſe the exerciſe of our own faculties) that ſo we might have apparent reaſon not to deny his Being, only becauſe we do not <hi>ocularly</hi> behold him. The nobleſt and moſt peculiar part of reaſon, is, to come to aſſurance of ſuch things as we do not ſee. There are a thouſand Propoſitions a man may make ſure to himſlef by his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which have no way been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſenſe. All the converſe we have with things paſt, and things future, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ſingly upon the exerciſe of reaſon: for there ſenſe cannot help us. If the Atheiſt will ſee every thing he believes, he muſt never believe any <hi>ſound,</hi> nor any <hi>ſmell.</hi> And (as one ſayes well) there is as much reaſon to deny that to be <hi>ſenſible,</hi> which is the object but of one ſenſe, as to deny that to <hi>be,</hi> whoſe exiſtence is only the object of reaſon. The ſenſes, being upon even terms, may more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably combate each other, in that caſe,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95663:85"/>than the whole of ſenſe deny a ſingle exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of reaſon; becauſe reaſon is a faculty more certain, and much ſuperiour to it. And if ever the faculty of our reaſon, abſtracted from ſenſe, can make us ſure of any thing, 'tis in this caſe, about a <hi>ſupreme Being.</hi> For in our ſelves we find an apprehenſion ſtill of ſomewhat above us: a fear of him, and a tendency towards him; which muſt needs ariſe from ſome <hi>innate Idea</hi> we have in our ſouls, of him. And this we are as ſure of, as that <hi>we think;</hi> which is the thing, in the world, we can be moſt ſure of. And theſe impreſſions of God, and the <hi>Idea</hi> we have in our ſelves of ſuch a ſupreme Being, does as much aſſure us, there is one; as our thinking does aſſure us that we our ſelves are, and that we have a thinking faculty. If we look out into the world, we ſhall find the <hi>whole</hi> (to our reaſon) a moſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable effect of him. There can be nothing more plain to the reaſon of mankind, than that there muſt be ſome <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> of every Being we ſee; and ſome firſt mover of all the motion we behold. The Atheiſt is alſo further diſingenuous in this: that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does not ſee God, (though there be never ſo much evidence of his Being) therefore he poſitively denies him, and ſayes, <hi>there is none;</hi> which there may be,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95663:85"/>for ought he knows. No man can, in the negative, ſay, <hi>there is not:</hi> nor lay down any tollerable ground to conclude ſuch a negative upon; becauſe there is not the leaſt violence offered to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, nor the leaſt abſurdity, either to ſenſe or reaſon, in this aſſertion, <hi>That there is a ſupreme Being infinitely perfect, that made all things.</hi> Nor will the Atheiſt help himſelf at all, by retorting this, and ſaying; <hi>If no man can poſitively deny the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what he never ſaw; then we can never, by that Rule, deny the Atheiſts Hypotheſis of Atoms, or of the worlds eternity: for they are all things alike unſeen.</hi> This I utterly deny: for, twere to make all things, we do not ſee, upon equal terms of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and negation. Which were, upon the matter, to depoſe our reaſon, and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate wholly into ſenſe. As if the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods making the world, (to which every thing rationally concurres,) and the firſt riſe of it (ſuppoſed to be by the <hi>caſual hitt of two Flints</hi> together, or a <hi>juſtling of Atoms</hi> one againſt another, or the fooliſheſt propoſition you can make) ſtood upon equal terms of admittance with a rational ſoul. And that one of theſe may be as well affirmed as the other:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95663:86"/>and none of them certainly denyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of them <hi>ſeen.</hi> This is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and in its tendency plainly baniſhes reaſon out of the world. <hi>Probation</hi> and <hi>negation,</hi> in this and all other caſes, are neceſſarily conjoyned and depend upon each other. For if one thing can be <hi>better proved</hi> than another, then 'tis <hi>leſs to be denyed</hi> than another. And as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative of any thing appears more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, the negative of it muſt needs be the more unreaſonable. And all things that <hi>we ſee not</hi> (as well as thoſe we <hi>ſee</hi>) are capable of more or leſs probability, and more or leſs certainty to our reaſon; and ſo have neceſſarily the ſame degrees in their affirmations and negations, that all other things have. The way obviouſly to clear this, is to conſider, whether a man may be certain of any thing he does not ſee; or whether all things unſeen are alike uncertain: if the firſt be made good, the ſecond, I am ſure, is thereby rendered falſe, That a man may be certain of things he never ſaw, I affirm: and that ſeveral waies: <hi>morally</hi> certain; <hi>naturally</hi> certain; and <hi>mathematically</hi> certain.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Morally certain.</hi> A man, by the concurrence of all circumſtances and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95663:86"/>teſtimonies about it, may be morally certain there is ſuch a <hi>City as Rome,</hi> though he were never there. And if he ſhould deny the certainty of it to himſelf, muſt either violently aſſault his own faculties, or render himſelf viſibly impotent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient in the exerciſe of them. The ground of this <hi>moral certainty,</hi> and the reaſon why, by credible teſtimonies, I may arrive at a certainty in ſuch a way, is; becauſe, that taking a meaſure of others by what I find in my ſelf, or by what I ſee experimentally in the daily practice of men, and in the courſe of the world, and in the reaſon of the thing it ſelf, ſuch a teſtimony muſt needs be true. Now ſuppoſe ſome, upon their own ſingle cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ſhall tell a man of a Town built upon the <hi>waves,</hi> and ſtanding in the midſt of the Sea; and that by <hi>chance</hi> the waves roll ſo continually under it, as to keep it from ſinking, and ſo it continually ſwims: will any man (well in his wits) ſay, that a <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to this, and a negative to the being of ſuch a place as <hi>Rome,</hi> are upon even terms? And that a man that has ſeen neither, may not upon better terms deny the one than the other?</p>
            <p>Secondly, I may be <hi>naturally</hi> certain of ſomewhat I do not ſee, by the fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95663:87"/>and intrinſique certainty of nature in its cauſe and productions. I am <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain</hi> I have thoughts and reaſon; and yet they are no way the object of ſenſe. I am naturally certain I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by a man, and brought forth by a woman. If any man will tell me, I was begotten by a Flie, or that a Whirlwind caſually blew ſome duſt together, and that, by that matter and motion, I came by chance to be made: becauſe I never <hi>ſaw</hi> the one more than the other, have I no more reaſon to deny the one than the other? If I can prove by reaſon, that the world could not be brought forth by the <hi>caſual motion of Atoms;</hi> nor be eternal in the poſture it now is, (which it muſt have been, if it be eternal;) have not I more reaſon to deny thoſe things, than an Atheiſt has to deny the Being of God, that has a full conjunction of reaſon to prove it; becauſe they are all things <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I may be <hi>mathematically cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of a thouſand Propoſitions, which I only revolve in my thoughts, and were never viſibly repreſented to my ſenſes: and am as well able to judge of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in my thoughts and my mind, and to affirm and deny things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95663:87"/>as if I ſaw the lines viſibly drawn before me. So 'tis in all ſpeculative mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and in all other matters, things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen muſt be judged of by things ſeen; and according to things known; and ſo are more or leſs probable, according to the proportion they bear to our reaſon exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about ſuch things. Reaſon has been ever the ſame; and the great Standard to determine all things by. What is an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity</hi> now, was ever ſo ſince the world began, and will continue ſo. Reaſon will as well determine about matters we never ſaw, as about things viſible to our ſenſes. He that will tell me of a Caſtle built upon a bulruſh, and a ſteeple upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a ſtraw; my reaſon will ſoon give him an anſwer, and look no further. Nor ought bare probabilities, where there is no apparent abſurdity, to ſteer us at all. But in the Atheiſts caſe, his aſſertions are not <hi>poſſibilities:</hi> for, if our faculties be not fallible, and deceive us, they are <hi>poſitive abſurdities.</hi> I ſay, bare poſſibilities ought not to ſteer us at all: becauſe a bare poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility is not any thing that appears to us to have any actual exiſtence; but only a reſult from this negative, that <hi>['tis not a contradiction, and ſo, not impoſſible.]</hi> From whence we may deduce endleſs <hi>Chimeraes,</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:95663:88"/>and all the fooliſh fancies imaginable. A man, in that caſe, is bounded with <hi>nothing,</hi> but a <hi>flat contradiction:</hi> and ſo may intangle himſelf with all the <hi>poſſible fooleries</hi> that can be in the world. 'Tis poſſible, that Trees do hear when we ſpeak, and that Stones do ſee us and look upon us; 'tis not impoſſible, becauſe 'tis not a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But to make ſuch things to have any power to influence or guide the rational ſoul, were highly to reproach our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to make them ſo weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedfaſt, as that the uſe of them would be thereby rendred far beneath what it truly and really is. Bare poſſibility ought not to entangle us in our aſſent or diſſent to any thing: becauſe 'tis poſitively no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; does not <hi>ponere aliquid;</hi> but has only a bare negative ſuppoſition of exiſtence, in not being impoſſible. 'Tis poſſible a Plant or Vegetable <hi>may</hi> have a rational ſoul: becauſe 'tis not a contradiction, and ſo not impoſſible; though we ſee no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects or concomitants of a rational ſoul in it. But, whoever ſhould let this <hi>bare poſſibility</hi> ſteer him, would much affront the certainty of his reaſon, which ought not, by ſuch a poſſibility, to be hindred from the certain knowledge of the nature of a Plant: becauſe that were to imagine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95663:88"/>to be ruled by a <hi>may be,</hi> a <hi>naked poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi> (which is a <hi>non-entity</hi>) againſt what really and actually <hi>is.</hi> He that comes only with a bare poſſibility, to confute me in any thing for which I bring proof, and give good reaſon, comes <hi>with juſt nothing:</hi> becauſe all things <hi>poſſible</hi> to be are no way <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be. That were to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction neceſſary: becauſe things may be, and may not be; and therefore where there is no actual demonſtration that they <hi>be,</hi> the poſſibility lies equal on both ſides, and is determined by the proofs on either ſide. Poſſibility is only previous to proof, and admits it; but is no proof at all it ſelf. Impoſſibility forbids all proof; poſſibility makes way for it, and does not more. This will appear evidently true, [that bare na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked poſſibility is no argument at all: nor is of any force, ſingly, either to prove or deny a thing;] if we do but conſider, that if <hi>poſſibility</hi> were any proof, then in all things, where there is <hi>poſſibility</hi> on both ſides, there were good proof on both ſides; which to ſay, were to make our faculties falſe, and a moſt notorious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, <hi>[that a thing might be proved to be, and proved not to be.]</hi> For 'tis nor, whether there be poſſibility on both ſides: for that there is; and that is no
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95663:89"/>more than to ſay, if a thing be, or if it be not, there is no contradiction either way, and ſo no impoſſibility either way. But if poſſibility be made of any force to affirm or deny a thing, then poſſibility is ſuppoſed to make a proof: and then it muſt needs make it both waies; and prove a thing may be, and prove a thing may not be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, 'tis both waies poſſible. 'Tis plain therefore, that bare poſſibility is no proof at all any way: and whenever the Atheiſt recurres to bare <hi>poſſibility</hi> to help him, he recurres to a meer <hi>nullity.</hi> He ſays, a thing <hi>is,</hi> becauſe it <hi>may be,</hi> and <hi>'tis not,</hi> becauſe it <hi>may not be:</hi> which (as to the proof of it, either way, either to its being, or not being) amounts to juſt nothing. In ſome caſes, impoſſibility proved of the one ſide, carries neceſſity on the other ſide. But whatſoever leaves things in ſuch and <hi>equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium,</hi> as poſſibility does, (which ſayes, they may be, or they may not be) can never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove the being of them either way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>diſingenuity</hi> of the Atheiſt will alſo further appear to us, if we conſider, that he himſelf admits inviſibility and infinity in his own ſuppoſed notions about the world; and yet object againſt them, when they are aſcribed to God. He admits them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95663:89"/>we know are no way capable of them; and yet denies them, when they are moſt properly attributed to our ſupreme Being infinitely perfect. He that will ſuppoſe <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> with an inherent <hi>motion</hi> in it, <hi>infinite,</hi> muſt needs ſuppoſe it to have all poſſible perfection. For whatſoever has <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> and <hi>ſelf-origination,</hi> muſt needs ſwallow up all perfection into it ſelf; or elſe no Being were capable of perfection. Now let us once exclude the notion of God out of the world, and where will you (with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſenſe, and without apparent abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) place <hi>infinity</hi> with abſolute perfection? The notion we have in our minds of ſuch a thing, plainly tells us there is ſuch a thing. And our reaſon aſſures us, it can be fixed no where, but in a ſupreme Being, which we call God. The world is, in its conſtitution, ſuch a thing, and ſo related to God, that the greateſt ſhifters off of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot give any tolerable account of the being of it to any reaſonable creature, without appropriating thoſe things, they moſt find fault with, and cavil at in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, to ſome part of the world. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they make the world <hi>infinite</hi> juſt as it is; or elſe ſome ſmall <hi>particles of matter</hi> with an <hi>inherent motion</hi> in them, they muſt be eternal. This ſhews a <hi>neceſſity of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> ſomewhere: and that all things that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95663:90"/>are, muſt needs come from ſomewhat that ever was, by the judgement of every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature; and that all mankind have naturally a notion and Idea of eternity within them. So that whoever denies the being of God, when he goes to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his denial, is forced to confeſs and admit thoſe things, which, he ſayes, are the grounds of his denyal: and ſo makes it a thing not only of the very ſame, but of ten times greater difficulty to believe, there is no God, than to confeſs there is one. For when he goes about to give a reaſonable account, how the world could come to be without ſome firſt cauſe: he is forced to admit all thoſe things he himſelf objects againſt a firſt cauſe; and beſides, lyes under all thoſe abſurdities the being of the world will caſt upon our reaſons, when we go about to give an account of it, excluding the notion of a God and a firſt cauſe from it.</p>
            <p>And as the Atheiſt is exceeding diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in his principles, and objections, ſo he is monſtrouſly <hi>unreaſonable. Firſt,</hi> In this, that he aſcribes the world to cauſes that have the higheſt <hi>improbability,</hi> and (in ſome caſes) <hi>impoſſibility,</hi> to our reaſon, plainly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis plainly <hi>impoſſible</hi> that the world, in the courſe we now ſee it, ſhould have been eternal, according to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95663:90"/>that <hi>Idea</hi> our ſouls are able to make of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For though we are not able to give a full deſcription of what is eternal; yet we are able to ſay <hi>negatively</hi> what we are ſure cannot be eternal. Suppoſe eternity to be never ſo much beyond me, and above me; yet 'twere abſurd for me to admit any thing to be eternal, that does not reach the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have of eternity.</p>
            <p>But grant to the Atheiſt the moſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to; which is, that there is a bare <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> that the world <hi>may</hi> have been eternal; and that there is no contradiction to ſay ſo; I think I have fully proved, that <hi>bare poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is no proof at all; nor ought to have the leaſt ſway with any reaſonable man, in the affirmation or negation of any thing. And therefore when the Atheiſt recurs (as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally he doth) to bare poſſibility to ſupport his notions; he is driven beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of all rational proof, and endeavours to make ſomething of an abſolute nothing. He takes that for proof, which only gives an admiſsion that there may be proof.</p>
            <p>Take him in the other way, in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Atoms,</hi> from whence he will needs derive the world: what an aſpect doth it carry to our reaſon? <hi>to imagine that Atoms, in a fancied vacuity, had an eternal gravity in them, which cauſed an eternal
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95663:91"/>motion of them up and down, without any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency at all to a center? and that they could never ceaſe their motion, till they hit by chance one againſt another, and were diverted that way? That this dull matter, and this ſenſleſs motion in it, cauſed by the internal gravity of it, did by chance produce this glorious fabrick of a rational ſoul? and ſo did transfer that to another, which it had not firſt in it ſelf? And that by the chance and caſuality of the motion of theſe Atoms, the world, and all the order and harmony of it, was firſt produced.</hi> The Atheiſt, in this, will never arrive at bare poſſibility. For the whole of it (ſo far as it is urged againſt Gods making the world, and made uſe of to ſelf-originate the world) is a perfect <hi>Syſteme of non-ſenſe.</hi> He that ſayes the world was made by chance, does, in effect ſay, <hi>[He cannot tell how it was made: and that when we deny God to be the Author of it, we can give no reaſonable account of it.]</hi> The Atheiſt is alſo further unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe he denies the being of that, which the world is a plain effect of, and the contemplation of the whole world doth rationally lead us unto. He denies alſo that to be, which we have an innate notion of in our own ſouls, which is, a ſupreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, abſolutely perfect: which the whole world will not afford us, nor can we fix our
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95663:91"/>notion of it upon any thing viſible. The capacity a man has, ſome way to conceive of ſuch a thing as a ſupreme and perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth evidently declare there is ſuch a Being that gave that capacity. He that goes about either to doubt it, or deny it, muſt in ſome meaſure admit it, or elſe he doubts and denies he knows not what. For when any man diſputes againſt a thing, 'tis granted he has a capacity to conceive of ſuch a thing, or elſe he could not oppoſe it. Had there not been a ſupreme Being which we call God, there could never have been any innate notions of it in the minds of men, in fears, hopes and concerns about him, as ſuch: No man ever had an <hi>original innate impreſſion of a lye,</hi> a pure nothing upon his intellect. That were to ſay, our faculties were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally falſe: and ſo we are nothing but a great deceit to our ſelves. Nay, to this day, no man ever thought of a meer nothing. Thoughts and exiſtence are relatives; <hi>Non entis nulla cogitatio.</hi> The wildeſt <hi>fantaſms</hi> that ever poſſeſſed the minds of men, were yet ſtill converſant about ſomewhat that was real and had exiſtence: and were but diſordered and miſplaced by the fancy. Let a man imagine Oxen feeding in the bottom of the Sea; and Whales grazing upon dry ground; or Mountains dancing in the Air;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95663:92"/>or any thing of that kind: the ground of all theſe imaginations is real things, and ſuch as do exiſt. They are only diſlocated by the fancy, and diſpoſed by the mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the courſe of nature: and ſo (in that diſpoſition and conjunction) are meer <hi>fantaſms,</hi> and <hi>entia rationis.</hi> But this we call an <hi>Idea</hi> of God, is quite another thing; 'Tis not a fictitious repreſentation the mind makes to it ſelf, from a collection of viſible objects, and corporeal fantaſms; but 'tis a notion of a Being abſtractedly conſidered, from whatever came in by the ſenſes; which can be no other but an <hi>Idea</hi> placed original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſoul, by an infinite and perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that firſt made it. A man finds in his own ſoul, he can conceive there is ſuch a Being, but yet cannot deſcribe him by any thing he ever ſaw. By which 'tis plain, the notion of ſuch a Being came not in by the ſenſes. Whatever is the object of ſenſe, hath infirmity annexed to it, becauſe 'tis ſtill diviſible; and therefore a notion of abſolute and infinite perfection could not ariſe from thence. Nor is it poſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ever mankind ſhould bow down themſelves, in that ſubjection they are in, to the notion of a Deity; if the notion of it were nothing but a vain fancied, colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of things diſorderly together, in the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95663:92"/>mind, that had come in by the ſenſes. For they muſt needs know, by the uſe of their reaſon, that ſuch things had no exiſtence in ſuch conjunction; but were a perfect va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Nor is there, in the notion of God, any unnatural diſorderly conjunction of things together: but all thoſe attributes we aſcribe to God, do naturally and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make up the notion of him, and cannot be ſeparated from it. Several ſteps our pure naturals take towards a ſupreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſatisfie and confirm us in the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of an Atheiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our reaſon conſiders, the whole world is without a firſt cauſe of any thing; and yet the conſtitution of it, is ſuch, that without ſome firſt cauſe, we can give no reaſonable account of any thing. We can never reaſonably be ſatisfied, how men ſhould come to beget one another in the way we ſee, without ſome firſt man that was <hi>not begotten</hi> in that way. Which firſt man muſt neceſſarily conduct us to ſome firſt and ſupreme cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Reaſon conſiders it ſelf the ſupremeſt parf of the world: and knows, by its own exerciſe, it could not be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by it ſelf. For that were to contradict its ſelf, and deny its own evidence. And ſo comes to adore ſomewhat above it ſelf,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95663:93"/>and more excellent than it ſelf; of which it has a natural <hi>inbred Idea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Reaſon layes down this as a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental <hi>maxim</hi> to it ſelf; that whatever we are able to think or imagine, of abſolute goodneſs, perfection, infiniteneſs, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of any kind, it muſt neceſſarily exiſt in this <hi>firſt cauſe;</hi> who gave us this ability to think and conceive of ſuch things, and made us with ſuch an Idea. So that to the utmoſt of what a man can do, to think well of God, and highly to adore him, his reaſon leads him to; and he can go no further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis highly reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he that was the firſt <hi>Donor</hi> of our beings, muſt needs have an abſolute <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> in us; and ſo we lye under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the homage we are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Becauſe the donation of a being to us, is the ſupremeſt obligation that could be put upon us. And whatſoever this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, that gave us our own being, ſhall at any time reveal to us to be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure about us, we ſtand for ever obliged to obey and ſubmit to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Our reaſon tells us, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we can conceive of the wiſeſt Builder, muſt be much more in Gods framing the world. He would not make the world without ſome propoſed end; which could
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95663:93"/>be no other but what beſt pleaſed himſelf. That faculty, that informs us of a ſupreme Power that made the world, will alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain us that he can uphold it, will govern it; and at laſt, have an account of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that end he firſt propoſed to himſelf in making it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We find in our own ſouls, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing taſte of good and evil; and a judgement we neceſſarily, and naturally paſs upon our ſelves, in reference to the one, and the other; being much ſatisfied in the one, and filled with terrours and fears by the other. And our reaſon tell us, all this muſt needs be, in order to a <hi>ſupreme judgement</hi> above us; and was placed in us, by a <hi>ſupreme Being</hi> that firſt made us. Were there nothing above our ſelves, we could have no higher end than to pleaſe our ſelves. When men find, in their own ſouls, troubles ariſing from thoſe actions that pleaſe them moſt, and which are no way cognizable, nor puniſhable perhaps in this world; that plainly relates it ſelf to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above and beyond themſelves. The truth is, our own ſouls determine, within our ſelves, the great end of all our actions to be pleaſing or diſpleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and laſtly, In full anſwer to the Atheiſts objection: my reaſon will tell me,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95663:94"/>that <hi>Gods being not ſeen by me,</hi> ſhould no way hinder, but further my belief of his Being and Exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I find enough in mine own make and conſtitution to inform me of him; <hi>naturally</hi> an inbred fear of him; an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; a tendency ſtill toward him; of which I am as ſure, as that I am ſure <hi>I think;</hi> which is the ſureſt evidence I can have, that <hi>I am;</hi> and an ability, in mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to <hi>reaſon</hi> all the world up to him, and derive all things from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When I conſider that this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being does neceſſarily exiſt, he muſt then be infinite; (for God and infinite are inſeparate.) And if he be infinite, he muſt alſo be then inviſible to a finite Being. If he were viſible to any thing <hi>finite,</hi> he could not himſelf be infinite, and then, he could not be God. How abſurd therefore to our reaſon is it, to deſire to <hi>ſee ſuch a Being</hi> as we aſcribe to God! I cannot graſp infinite in my mind; much leſs then can I make it the object of my ſight. Infinite could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, were it any way comprehendſible. Mine eye cannot view the whole world at once, which yet is finite and circumſcribed: much leſs, what is boundleſs and infinite. 'Tis a mean and narrow deſign, to confine the notion of God and his Being to our
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95663:94"/>
               <hi>eye-ſight,</hi> when we have ſo much a nobler capacity to give us a view of him. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we conſider we cannot ſee the nobleſt part of our ſelves, which is our own ſouls: nor are we able to converſe by our <hi>ſight</hi> with ſuch things, as are proper objects for it, but we are ſoon at a loſs. We cannot look upon the heavenly bodies, ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs their dimenſions in our eye-fight. What ſmall things are the Sun, Moon and Stars, to him that is no otherwiſe informed than by his eyes? The leaſt diſtance out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does our ſight, and deceives us. And yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſerve the Atheiſt but an <hi>ocular view of an infinite Being.</hi> 'Twere much more practicable and reaſonable to ſay, he would not believe there was ſuch a thing as the <hi>Sea,</hi> unleſs he could take it up in the palm of his hand. Nor will not be ſatisfied that the Sun is a body of light, by the beams of it, unleſs he can put it into a Lanthorn.</p>
            <p>This diſcovers to us the grounds of that <hi>natural Religion</hi> that directly oppoſeth an Atheiſt in the whole of his undertaking. The fundamentals of this <hi>natural Religion</hi> are fixed, and ſecured: <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal impreſſion God left of himſelf, upon us at our firſt make. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the true exerciſe of that faculty, we call reaſon. 'Tis this natural univerſal Religion by which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95663:95"/>God intended to uphold the frame and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world: and without which, it cannot ſubſiſt. Here ought uniformity to be expected, and ſtrictly required. Things ſupernatural have not had that univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but have been the peculiar happineſs and advantage of ſome times, and ſome places: and are not <hi>eſſentially</hi> neceſſary to the frame and being of the world.</p>
            <p>Nor will the Atheiſt, in the leaſt, invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the truth of this <hi>natural Religion,</hi> by ſaying, <hi>There are very few that have ſuch an exerciſe of reaſon as to arrive at ſuch principles.</hi> For when we ſay any thing is reaſonable, we need ſay no more of it, than that it is attainable by reaſon. We ſpeak of what is vertually in that principle, what it may do: not what every individual man does, in the exerciſe of it. What is in it ſelf intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically reaſonable, and will appear ſo to men, when they make uſe of their reaſon, we may well call reaſonable, though there be never ſo few that attain to an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it. How many concluſions are there in <hi>Geometry,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> that are in themſelves perfectly reaſonable and true, and will appear ſo to every mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he will make a right uſe of it! And yet there are perhaps, at the preſent, very few in the world that underſtand
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95663:95"/>them. And were he not a very vain man, that would therefore deny the reaſon of them, and ſo conſequently admit nothing to be reaſonable or true, but what every individual perſon actually comprehends and aſſents to?</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>my Lord,</hi> I have led you through a <hi>wilderneſs;</hi> a diſcourſe unpoliſhed; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the common high waies of <hi>method,</hi> and ſuch <hi>artificial ornaments,</hi> as we have to pleaſe us, in thoſe places where we chuſe <hi>to live,</hi> beyond what we find where we are ſometimes forced to <hi>travel.</hi> When you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Journey you have had through theſe papers, I can provide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make you admit it tolerably plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; but to tell you, that you have all the way, ſeen a <hi>pillar of fire,</hi> and <hi>pillar of cloud:</hi> you have ſeen a dark ſide, and a light ſide; the <hi>Atheiſts dark ſide,</hi> the cloud of abſurdity and folly that hangs over him; how weak that man is, that fights againſt God: his own reaſon diſarms him, and he becomes a captive to himſelf. You have ſeen a <hi>light ſide</hi> alſo, thoſe clear perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous evidences we have of God: and that he walks not in the dark; but has light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to himſelf, by the bright beams of our underſtandings: and has commiſſioned the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95663:96"/>
               <hi>meaneſt creature</hi> we converſe with, and made it his Ambaſſadour to treat with us about him; and written his <hi>credential cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> upon the whole world, and given it in charge to declare his Being. This we have made Canonical, by two good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy work.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivers it as a great Oracle of Divine Truth, <hi>that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> In man, above all the reſt, he has fixed a perpetual memorial of himſelf; and obliged him to a peculiar adherence to his Creator, in that he has honoured him with <hi>his Image;</hi> that ſo he ſhould never deny his God, but he ſhould fall below himſelf: nor <hi>blaſpheme</hi> that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, without <hi>defiling</hi> his own. He has ſtamped his image and ſuperſcription upon man, that ſo he might know whoſe he is, and to whom, as a due tribute, he ought ſtill to render himſelf. That divine ſpark, that heavenly image, that rational ſoul, is that nobleſt part of the world, wherein God chiefly inthrones himſelf: and by which he puts in his claim to the whole that he has made. Nor can man (that is ſo qualified,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95663:96"/>that finds a tincture of divinity in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; that carries about him ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rayes of rational light, and moves under that conduct, when he is truly himſelf:) ever make this viſible world his ultimate center. The more vigorous and enlarged the ſoul is, the ſooner it ſurfeits with the <hi>whole</hi> of the world: and when it has tryed the utmoſt of it, denies it ſelf ſatisfied, and claims a relation to ſomewhat above it, and beyond it. Had the whole of the world been for ever nothing but a continued circle of it ſelf; were mankind at the top of their <hi>Pedigree</hi> in things viſible; could they derive themſelves no higher than bare <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion;</hi> the mind could never travel beyond thoſe confines. Were this world the higheſt original of man, it muſt needs contain his ultimate ſatisfaction, and be the perfect boundary of his ſoul. No cauſe ever produced an effect with a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple beyond it ſelf; nor did ever any man preſs after that, which he had not firſt an <hi>Idea</hi> of in his own breaſt. The world could never ſtamp any character upon its off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, but it ſelf; nor propagate a genius above its own: nor can it further thoſe <hi>noble Salleys</hi> the ſoul makes beyond it. The tendency we are made with to a ſupreme and perfect Being, plainly tells us, ſuch a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95663:97"/>Being does exiſt. Whenever we deny thoſe tranſparent effects of a Deity in our ſelves; and would cancel that innate Idea God has leſt of himſelf within us; and make a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe hopes and fears we find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to ſomewhat above us; we may with equal reaſon oppoſe the truth of our own affections and paſſions, and ceaſe to be ſure of whatever our ſouls inform us. And while we contend againſt the real exiſtence of a ſupreme Being, we deny the truth of our own faculties. For whatever can aſcertain us, there is no God, may go far to aſſure us, that we are in our own Beings, <hi>nothing but a great cheat to our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have now taken my leave of the Atheiſt. What the ſucceſs of our encounter has been, reſts with you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. I know there is an <hi>Exciſe and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> to be payed to the <hi>Criticks</hi> of this age, before any thing can freely paſs; of which I am no way careful. I mean hereafter to be as little concerned about the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> as he can be about Religion: and to create no more trouble to my ſelf, where I have arrived at a perfect ſatisfaction. If nothing will ſerve his turn but a <hi>negative,</hi> upon that, which himſelf and every thing beſides is an affirmation of, let him feed upon his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95663:97"/>own diſtemper, and feaſt himſelf with his own diſeaſe. 'Tis not to be denyed, but that a rational conqueſt is there leaſt to be hoped for, where the underſtanding is but a ſecond to the will; and the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the judgement truckles to the violence of inclination. No Map can be drawn, wherein we can have a clearer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that a man is ſunk beneath himſelf, and ſtruggles under a defection from a primitive <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> than that his will ſometimes gives the Law, and playes the Tyrant over the reſt of his faculties. 'Twas at this back door of the <hi>will,</hi> that <hi>Atheiſm</hi> firſt entered. 'Twas the <hi>deſire</hi> men had there ſhould be no God, that firſt cheated the underſtanding, or at leaſt bribed it, to diſpute againſt him. No mans reaſon would ever have attempted to derive the world from any thing but God, had not the <hi>will</hi> been in open hoſtility with him; and declared war againſt that intereſt, that ſtood up for God in the ſoul. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> may indulge himſelf in his own abſurdities; yet having weighed him in the balance of right reaſon, and finding his principles light, empty, full of falſhoods and contradictions; and in the complex of them, a <hi>meer nothing;</hi> I have taken him as one legally condemned, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95663:98"/>do think my ſelf reaſonably juſtified <hi>to hang him up in Effigie.</hi> And therefore, as the moſt pertinent <hi>Appendix</hi> to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I have preſented <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> with an Atheiſts <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> wherein you ſhall ſee him <hi>epitomized,</hi> and an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repreſent an <hi>image</hi> of him, as much to the life, as ſo ſmall a figure will afford.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have, by this, performed but a part of my duty to you: my firſt intention did much exceed what I have been yet able to accompliſh. Two further attempts were deſigned to accompany theſe Papers. Firſt, <hi>A rational proof, that the Scriptures are undoubtedly and truly the word of God:</hi> and that we have reaſon abundantly ſufficient to acquieſce in them, as ſuch. Where I would have imployed that little ſtrength I have, to have reſcued them from ſome violent hands that are lately laid upon them; and juſtified their <hi>divine Authority</hi> againſt the perverſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of abſurd and <hi>illogical men.</hi> And, Secondly, have adventured in a Scripture-glaſs, to have repreſented to you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that admirable contrivement, <hi>Of ſaving men by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST:</hi> to which right reaſon, as well as the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95663:98"/>Scripture, is an entire witneſs. Wherein we ſhall find all things concurring, that might become the deſigns of <hi>infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> in magnifying in ſelf; and reach the whole of mens concerns, in the utmoſt of their exaltation and happineſs. How far opportunity will ever encourage the execution of the firſt intentions; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall be able to advance another ſtep beyond this ground I have been now endeavouring to make good; is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion lies unreſolved in the womb of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</hi> What has already adventured your <hi>Lordſhips view,</hi> this <hi>ſmall Eſſay</hi> towards the publick ſervice of Religion, I am ſure you will at the ſame time pardon and accept. As you are too juſt to blame a mean crop, when you conſider it comes from an hungry ſoil; ſo you are too wiſe to waſte expectation, where you muſt needs be denyed a return; or to caſt away the leaſt hope of any thing valuable, from one that has attained no further amongſt mankind, than that <hi>inconſiderable Roman,</hi> who had nothing to boaſt of, but <hi>a jus trium liberorum.</hi> 'Tis enough to my ſelf, I have obeyed <hi>your Lordſhip;</hi> who by the choice of this ſubject, did at once both command and oblige me. It will be ever a pleaſure to me any way to avow
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95663:99"/>thoſe manifold obligations I have to you: nor will I ever ceaſe to do it. Reſolving never to forfeit my own truth to my ſelf, nor to become a ſufferer under that uneaſte reproach of ingratitude.</p>
